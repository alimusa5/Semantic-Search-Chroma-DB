Regulators have also stepped up their engagement in 2H21, but we \\nthink the market will need more from Federal US regulators to maintain the \\ninnovation momentum. \\nFor investors who want to greater insights into the cryptomarkets and some of its \\ninner workings, we offer a 101 -primer with both a discussion on how the \\ncryptomarkets work, as well as the state of the cryptocurrency markets as we see \\nthem today.  We expect the evolution of the cryptomarkets could accelerate in 2022, \\nparticularly for financial services should the promise of greater capacity and \\ntransaction speeds be delivered by upgrades to layer -1 chain Ethereum and/or new \\nlayer-2 initiatives.  \\nOur takeaway continues to be that taking the time to better understand the \\ncryptoecosystem is worth the effort. We see the likelihood that the cryptoecosyst em \\nwill be much bigger at the end of the year than it is today, and will have permeated \\nfar more of traditional finance three years from now than it has currently.  As such \\nwe see both the likelihood of more winning business models and investment \\nopportuni ties, as well as businesses that have the potential to become \\ndisintermediated.  The leading caveat to our bullish outlook remains regulation and \\nour concern that bending the existing regulatory framework to adapt to the \\ncryptoecosystem could constrain the innovation needed to better develop the \\ncryptocurrency  markets here in the US. However, we see politicians as having a far \\nbetter understanding of the cryptomarkets at year -end 2021 than they did at the \\nbeginning, an understanding thatwe think is a key i ngredient to better regulation.   \\nEvolution of the CryptoEcosystem\\nFigure 1: Timeline of Key CryptoEcosystem Milestone sin Recent Years\\nSource: Onyx by JPMorgan\\nThe cry ptoecosystem is still early in its development, being only fourteen years since \\nSatoshi Nakamoto wrote his/her/their whitepaper that jumpstarted the development \\nof Bitcoin and whi ch ultimately gave way to other developments such as Ethereum, \\nsmart contracts, tokenization, NFTs, Web3.0 and the Metaverse.  \\n4North A merica Equity Research\\n10 January 2022Kenneth B. W orthington, CFA\\n(1-212) 622 -6613\\nkenneth.b.worthington@jpmorgan.com\\n     \\n          \\nFor thos e that are beginning their journey into the cryptoecosystem, there are some \\nconcepts that helped usbetter understand the value of cr yptocurrencies, which helped \\nusset a base off of which to more fully explore the cryptomarkets. \\n1)Cryptocurrencies are tech nology . While investors trade tokens like assets, \\ncryptomarkets are te chnology and the underlying use cases are a big driver \\nof their value.  This technology is also the basis for communities that \\ndevelop around cryptocurrency projects, but in our view the technology \\ncomes first and is more important to the initial value creation. \\n2)The tokens are linked to blockchains. Investors with whom we have spoken \\nare far more willing to ascribe value to blockchains than they are to \\ncryptocurrencies.  There is a more easily  accepted belief that blockchain \\ntechnology has value, w hile the digital tokens are a retail driven pyramid \\nscheme.  However, the tokens and the blockchains are linked.  \\nDecentralized blockchains need a token with value to incentivize the\\nvalidation of the blockchain ― there needs to be a token and that token \\nneeds to have value in both proof -of-stake and proof -of-work.  While this \\ntoken value will fluctuate with supply and demand and thus the tokens can \\nget overvalued, a token with value is nonethele ss a necessary component of \\na decentralized blockchain. \\n3)Token value is based on the use cases for the blockchain. The value of the \\ntoken is set by the market, based on supply and demand.  Transactions on a \\nblockchain are paid in the native token and thus one needs to purchase the \\nunderlying token to transact.  For example, ERC -721 tokens (also referred \\nto as NFTs) are bought and sold with Eth (Ether) and gas prices (transaction \\nfees) are also paid in Eth. Acquiring Eth to transact in Ethereum based \\nproject s drives up the value of the Ether token. \\nThe Evolution of the CryptoEcosystem\\nWe see the development of the cryptoecosystem happening in three stages: 1) \\nBitcoin, 2) Ethereum and Smart Contracts, and 3) Tokens and the Metaverse.  Each \\ndevelopmental stage builds on the prior and with each stage there are more \\nopportunities to create new engagement and more fulsome communities, and thus \\ndevelop incremental business and revenue opportunities that didn’t exist in the past. \\nWhile we expect disintermediation, w e see the cryptomarkets more about creating \\nnew opportunities for engagement and thus more new business opportunities.  (NFTs \\nin Art Basil Miami brought out new artists and new buyers, complementing rather \\nthan disintermediating the traditional art world, for example.)\\nWe view Bitcoin as being mature in its value proposition, although adoption could \\nstill grow quite materially.  Ethereum / Smart Contract devel opment and adoption \\nalso appear to us to be quite early and depending on the impact of the merge on\\ncapacity  and transaction costs could propel the protocol to permeate gaming, \\nfinancial services, real estate and other businesses and asset classes.  We see \\ntokenization (non -fungible tokens) and the Metaverse still a t their infancy.  While \\nNFTs have represented an evolution in the art world and seem poised to infiltrate and \\nalter the gaming industry, we see NFT s and tokenization in their infancy.  We still \\nsee Web3.0 and the Metaverse as ‘ in-development.’ \\nWith this in mind, we walk through the evolution of the cryptoecosystem in more of \\na chronological order as we see each stage building on the prior.  While many new to 5North A merica Equity Research\\n10 January 2022Kenneth B.

It operates a permissionless \\nand decentralized ledger on which all Bitcoin transactions are recorded. Anyone can \\njoin and interact with the Bitcoin blockchain , and Bitcoin users can send ‘value’ from \\none account or wallet to another in matter of minutes, without the involvement of a \\nbank or financial institution. Think about transactions as emailing value to anyone or \\nanyentity  anywhere in the world, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year. \\nInherent in the bitcoin software is a hard limit cap of 21 million coins. There will \\nnever be more than that in existence and based on the current pace of mining, it will \\ntake u ntil 2140 for all the bitcoin to make it into circulation. \\nThe History of Bitcoin Starts with a White Paper with an \\nUnknown Author\\nBitcoin was created following the release of a white paper by Satoshi Nakamoto\\nwhich created an incentive structure that le d to the creation of Bi tcoin . The digital \\ncurrency  was intended to provide an alternative payment system that would operate \\nfree of central control but otherwise be used just like traditional currenc ies.From \\nhere, it has grown to be a well -recognized store of value ,with a market capitalization \\nof $871bn (as of Jan -4).  \\nFigure 2: Market Capitalization of Bitcoin Surges in 2020/2021\\n$ billion\\nSource: Bloomberg Finance L .P.and  J .P.

By seeing the steps involved in such a \\ntransfer, we think it helps in better understanding the cryptoecosystem. \\nUnderstanding Pu blic and Private Keys –The Keys to Cryptography\\nThe transfer of bitcoin from one person to another utilizes p ublic and private keys, \\nintegral parts of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. These keys work in combination \\nto allow participants to send and rec eive cr yptocurrency without requiring a third \\nparty  like a bank to verify the transactions. The public and private keys fit together as \\na key  pair, and while o ne may  share the public key in order to receive transactions, \\nthe private key enables ownership. If anyone gains access to the private key, they \\nwill also have access to any cryptocurrency associated with those keys.\\n7North A merica Equity Research\\n10 January 2022Kenneth B.

Morgan .\\nA transaction that transfers bitcoin from wallet -1 from person -1 to another person -2 \\nin wallet -2 works something like this:\\n1.Person -1 wants to send one bitcoin to person -2. \\n2.Person -1 opens his/her wallet -1 and scans person -2’s wallet -2 to obtain the \\nwallet -2 public key, which is a series of letters and numbers that a user must \\nshare in order to receive funds. \\n3.Wallet -1 provides the private key to wallet -2, as well as the amount of Bitcoin \\nthat is going to be transferred, i n this case one bitcoin.  In addition, the sender \\nPerso n-1 will also include a mining fee that is measured in Satoris/vbyte, with \\nthe average transaction 250bytes and thus the typical fee $76 or ~15bps. \\n4.The wallet will communicate the transaction details to a node, which is any \\ncomputer (a simple PC/laptop) t hat sto res the entire bitcoin blockchain.  As of \\nthe writing of this note, there are ~12,000 bitcoin nodes that are all \\ninterconnected, and communicate with all the other nodes in the network and \\nvalidate the transaction. \\n5.Nodes will hold the verified Bitc oin transactions in a mempool (waiting area for \\nbitcoin transactions). Here, miners that have solved the complex cryptographic \\nhash puzzle (discussed in more detail later in the note) will pick up the validated \\nbitcoin transactions. Because a mempool might store 3mbs of transaction data \\nand because each bitcoin block only holds 1mb of data , the miner will s ort the \\ntransaction in the mempool typically  by the mining fee, and will add these \\nhigher fee transactions to the block and will collect both the mining fee and the \\nmining reward (6.25 bitcoin). Once the transaction is reported to the b lock, the \\ntransaction is complete. \\nAs seen in the process above, a higher transaction fee will lead to faster execution \\nsince itis more profitable for the miner.  If the m ining fee is below average, the \\ntransaction could be sorted to the bottom of the mempool and may wait unconfirmed \\n8North A merica Equity Research\\n10 January 2022Kenneth B.

Until the transaction makes it to the \\nblockchain, it is not complete. \\nPrivate keys are the foundati on of security for cryptocurrency transactions. Private \\nkeys are generated by pseudorandom number generators (PRNGs) to generate \\nthese random positive integers. Private keys for Bitcoin and Ethereum are 78 digits \\nlong with the set of numbers from which a k ey is selected so massive in size, roughly \\nthe same size as the number of visible atoms in the universe, the probabilities of \\ngenerating two of the same private keys is negligible. As of today, there have been \\nno known hacks that have allowed someone to si gn transactions without knowing the \\nprivate key. \\nThe Process of Mining and Proof of Work\\nThe bitcoin blockchain is validated via the proof -of-work protocol, a consensus \\nmechanism used to confirm that netwo rk participants (called miners) calculate valid \\nalphanumeric codes (called hashes), verify Bitcoin transactions and include them in \\nthe next block added to the blo ckchain. \\nMiners Represent the Security Mechanism for Bitcoin\\nMining was introduced as the solution to the double -spend problem. If I have 1 \\nBitcoin and I send it to someone , and then try sending that same Bitcoin to another \\nperson , the network ensures that only one transaction will be accepted. It does this \\nthrough mining. Oneof the key features of Bitcoin is itsdecentralization , operating a \\ndigital ledger securely without the involvement of a bank, government or other \\ncentral authority. But the distributed network needs a mechanism to act as the final \\narbiter, to ensure that nobody manipulates the blockchain for their own purpos e(such \\nas to double spend existing bitcoin as above ). Mining is this decentralized security \\nsystem. \\nThe Digital Ledger Allows for the Ownership of a Digital Asset\\nTo operate a decentralized digital ledger that can be trusted is a challenge, and the \\nblock chain is the best decentralized mechanism yet created and widely accepted to \\nown a digital asset.  Because digital assets can be copied exactly, the \\ndatabase/accounting ledger recorded on the blockchain for all to see and verify \\nallows one to show the tran saction history of the digital asset and ultimately to prove \\nownership. Ownership of a digital asset, an asset that can be exactly reproduced in \\ncode, is a true innovation of the blockchain and proof of work as a validation of this \\nblockchain is again an i ncredible innovation. \\nProof -of-Work –The Protocol that Validates the Blockchain\\nBitcoin uses the proof -of-work protocol to validate the blockchain, the process by \\nwhich the digital ledger is updated by adding new blocks with all the most recent \\ntransacti ons. This proof-of-work protocol is often described as solving a \\n“cryptographic puzzle. ”The underlying tech nology that powers this immutability \\nand security is cryptographic hashing. A cryptographic hash function is a \\nmathematical function that, simply pu t, takes any input and quickly maps it to a \\nfixed -size string output.  Crypt ographic hashin g is deterministic (any input will \\nalways generate the same output), fast, unique (each input with result in a random \\nand unique output such that no two inputs will ever result in the same output), and \\nirreversible (given the output of the hash function, one cannot determine the input ).\\nThe algorithm Bitcoin uses to generate the hash is called SHA -256, whichalways \\ngenerates hashes asa 256bit number, the equivalent of 64 characters.  SHA -256 is an 9North A merica Equity Research\\n10 January 2022Kenneth B.

Bitcoin\\'s proof -of-\\nwork algorithm then generates a hash for the block.  Think of a hash like a \\nfingerprint that identifi es a speci fic piece of data.\\nMining Explained\\nMining is the process duri ng which all transactions are broadcast to the network and \\nareusually confirmed within 10 -20 minutes.  Mining is a distributed consensus \\nsystem that is used to confirm pending transactions by including them in the \\nblockchain. It enforces a chronological order in the block chain, protects the \\nneutrality  of the network, and allows different computers to agree on the state of the \\nsystem. To be confirmed, transactions must be packed i n ablock thatfit very strict \\ncryptographic rules that will b e verified by the network. These rules prevent previous \\nblocks from being modified (altering the records of past transactions for example)\\nbecause doing so would easily  and visibly invalidate all the subseque nt blocks. \\nMining also creates the equivalent of a competitive lottery that prevents certain \\nminers from repeatedly /consecutively adding new blocks to the block chain. In this \\nway, no group or individuals can control what is included in the block chain or \\nreplace parts of the block chain to their advantage .\\nMiners and Rewards\\nThe process of Bitcoin mining involves specially designed computers that aggregate \\nBitcoin transactions into a block to add to the blockchain.  In exchange, the miners 1) \\ncollect trans actio n fees and 2) are paid a reward in the form of Bitcoin by the \\nnetwork.  The process starts with Bitcoin miners selecting one megabyte worth of \\ntransactions, bundling them as an input into the SHA -256 function, and attempting to \\nfind a specific output (solving the cryptographic puzzle) the network accepts. This \\npuzzle is complex and requires significant computational resources to solve.  \\nHowever once solved, the puzzle is both easy to verify as the right solution by the \\nbroader network, while also simul taneously validating all current and past \\ntransactions in the blockchain.  Think of mining as solving a complex 10,000 picture \\npuzzle on the dinner table –it is challenging to put together but once completed it is \\neasy to verify  that all the pieces have b een put together properly.  The first miner to \\nsolve the cryptographic puzzle and find this output will publish the block to the \\nnetwork and w illreceive a reward in the form of transaction fees and the creation of \\n6.25 new Bitcoin, currently valued at ~$3 25,000.  A new Bitcoin block is added \\nevery 10 minutes, which makes the business of mining a big business. We note that \\nroughly ever y four y ears, the software running on the blockchain makes it half as \\nprofitable to mine bitcoin as it r educesthe size of the block rewards.\\nThe Cryptographic Puzzle –Hash This Hash That\\nA bitcoin block contains a header and a record of all of the new transactions, \\nincluding buyer, seller, time and date of the transactions. Each block has a unique \\nheader that is comprised of s ix pieces of information: 1) client software version, 2) \\ntimestamp of the block, 3) root o f the containing transactions’ M erkle tree, 4) hash of \\nthe prio r block, 5) a nonce and 6) the target. \\nFirst –let’s start with how a Merkle tree cha rt works.  10North A merica Equity Research\\n10 January 2022Kenneth B.

Morgan .\\nThe M erkle root (at the top of Figure 5) acts as the effective summary of all of the \\ntransactions in the block.  A Merkletree is simple concept where transaction leaves\\nare hashed together using SHA -256 into parents, and parents are hashed together \\nwith those outputs again hashed until a single Merkle root,which becomes the \\nunchangeable summary of all of the transactions in the block. If one of the \\ntransactions in the b lock were changed at a later date, the output in the Merkleroot \\nwould change all the way up the tree and would be easily recognized by any \\ncomputer node looking at the root (the top hash in the graphic below.)\\nFigure 6: When a Le af in the Merkle Tree Changes, the Parent and Root Is Altered\\nSource: J.P. Morgan .\\nFinding the Correct Nonce that Leads to the Correct Block Hash\\nThe core of mining comes from the nonce and the target, which are the basis for the \\ncryptographic puzzle th at minors have to solve to create the new block. The miner is \\ntrying to find the number (the nonce) that when added to a combination of the known \\ninformation in the header including the hash of the previous block, the transaction \\nhash of the existing block , and the timestamp of the existing block can be hashed \\ntogether using SHA -256 to generate the correct 67 digit output (the correct hash \\nsignature) for the block to be included on the blockchain.  \\nhash (ABCD)Top Hash / Merkle Root\\nhash (C)Hash Parent\\nhash (D)Hash Parent\\nhash (CD)Hash Parent\\nCTransaction Leaves\\nDTransaction Leaves\\nhash (A)Hash Parent\\nhash (B)Hash Parent\\nhash (AB)Hash Parent\\nATransaction Leaves\\nBTransaction Leaves Data \\nBlocks\\nhash (ABCD)Top Hash / Merkle Root\\nhash (C)Hash Parent\\nhash (D)Hash Parent\\nhash (CD)Hash Parent\\nCTransaction Leaves\\nDTransaction Leaves\\nhash (A)Hash Parent\\nhash (B)Hash Parent\\nhash (AB)Hash Parent\\nATransaction Leaves\\nBTransaction Leaves Data \\nBlocks11North A merica Equity Research\\n10 January 2022Kenneth B.

Both the target and the output hash are incredibly large \\nnumbers. When converted to base -10, they  are 67 digits long.  So miners will hash \\nthe block header together with their guess at the nonce over and over un til they find a \\nnonce that works. For the first block, the genesis block in Bitcoin and the easiest of \\nthe cry ptographic puzzles, it took nearly 2.1bn computations to find a nonce that \\nresulted in a hash that was acceptable. It has gotten much harder since then. \\nBelow in Figure 8, we show how the block header from one block becomes a \\ncomponent of the block header for the next block .  Go back to the Merkle tree ― if \\nany old block is altered ,the entire chain is changed ,which can be easily recognized \\nby the community, which can revert back to the prior chain. \\nFigure 8: Visual Representation of the Bitcoin Blockchain and the Role of the Block Header \\nSource: J.P. Morgan.\\nOnce a miner finds a correct nonce, the calculated hash (signature) is added to the \\nblock’s header. The signature acts as a block lock, preventing further changes to the \\ntransactions stored inside the block. The ‘winning’ miner broadcasts the complete \\nblock to other nodes that verify that the nonce results in a correct hash signature. \\nOnce 50% of the nodes verify the block, a state of consensus is reached and the block \\nis considered valid and the entire network adds the block to the chain. \\nThe miner who co rrectly  publishes the block is rewarded with new bitcoin, currently \\n6.25 bitcoin. This takes place in the mining process, as miners areallowed to add an \\nadditional output transaction to the block that attributes 6.25bitcoin to themselves. \\nEvery four years , the reward for mining bitcoin will fall in half.  Sometime in early \\n2024, the reward will fall from 6.25bitcoin to 3.125 bitcoin.  Once all the bitcoin are \\nmined sometime in 2140, miners will work solely for the mining fee. \\nThe Bitcoin network protocol adjusts the algorithm’s difficulty every two weeks to \\nmaintain a 10 minute average block time. As computational power increases (i.e., \\nthe network mining capacity increases), the time to create a block falls, and the target \\n12North A merica Equity Research\\n10 January 2022Kenneth B.

On the contrary, if computational power declines (i.e., the \\nnetwork mining capacity declines), as what happened when China banned bitcoin \\nmining last year, the target is made easier .\\nThe Value of Bitcoin \\nNothing inherently valuable underpins the bitcoin network , similar to many  of the \\nworld’s fiatcurrencies since leaving thegold standard .  However, we do see value \\ndriven by  the Bitcoin technology that enables both the concept of digital scarcity and \\nultimately its merit as a store of value. Such digital scarcity has become more \\nvaluable since the o utbreak of Covid -19 that contributed to a significant increase in \\nglobal government debt and drove some to look for alternatives to fiat currencies as \\nglobal stores of value. \\nIn our opinion, Bitcoin is particul arly well designed as a modern store of value, and \\nthe strong design has contributed to the increased confidence in and value of Bitcoin. \\nWhile many are buying cryptocurrencies (chasing in our opinion) because the \\ncryptocurrencies are appreciating and/or a re meaningfully outperforming other asset \\nclasses, we think the merits of Bitcoin will endure near -term fluctuations in value, \\nboth in terms of digital scarcity as well as a good store of value.\\nDefining a Store of Value –Eight Characteristics \\nOur resear ch indicates that there are eight characteristics that define a good store of \\nvalue.  We see Bitcoin as being distinguished in six, but disadvantaged in two.  \\nRelative to gold, we see Bitcoin is at least or more durable, portable, fungible, \\nvisible, scarce , verifiable, and free from censorship. However, Bitcoin falls short of \\ngold in its history as a store of value and we add a ninth as a greater level of price \\nvolatility . \\n\\uf0b7Durable –Bitcoin cannot be destroyed nor does it perish.  It will survive as long \\nas the network survives, which given the network is decentralized makes bitcoin \\nvery hard to destroy. Wheat, soybeans, corn and other food items have failed in \\nhistory  as stores of value because they are perishable. When comparing gold to \\nbitcoin, both are durable.\\n\\uf0b7Portable –Bitcoin is particularly easy to store and transport. Large quantities of \\nBitcoin can be transmitted all over the world nearly instantly and can be stored \\non a cell phone.  Gold is far harder and more expensive to store, transport and \\ninsure.\\n\\uf0b7Fungible –Bitcoin is fungible and is interchangeable with all other Bitcoin. Gold \\nis generally fungible and can be readily seen as better than diamonds ,which can \\nhave different qualities and s hapes that impact value. That said, gold comes in \\ndiffer ent measures of purity with 24k gold and 14k gold of different values. The \\nedge goes to Bitcoin. \\n\\uf0b7Divisible –Bitcoin is divisible out to eight decimal places, out to 1/100,000,000, \\nwhich today is worth $0.0005. Gold is divisible, but not easily accurately . \\n\\uf0b7Scarce –Bitcoin has a finite number of tokens, capped at 21mn, which will be \\nmined by ~2140.  Gold is difficult to mine and there is expected to be a finite \\namount.  However, as the price of gold rises, so does the supply. 13North A merica Equity Research\\n10 January 2022Kenneth B. W orthington, CFA\\n(1-212) 622 -6613\\nkenneth.b.worthington@jpmorgan.com\\n     \\n          \\n\\uf0b7Verifiable –Bitcoin is read ily verifiable with transactions recorded on the \\nblockchain ,which is publicly available for all to view. Gold too is verifiable, but \\ncan also be forged and its purity can be diluted ,making value more questionable.  \\n\\uf0b7Free from censorship –A censorship re sistant asset cannot be stopped or \\nconfiscated by any authority, including governments. Users are uninhibited from \\nowning or transferring value at their discretion. No entity (including developers \\nor miners) has any undue influence on a users’ Bitcoin.  As such, Bitcoin is \\ncensorship resistant and because the protocol is decentralized, it is not subject to \\nthe demand or constraints of large corpor ations or governments. Government s \\ndo and have restricted both the ownership of gold and the transfer of gold \\nthroughout history. The Gold Reserve Act of 1934 prohibited the American \\npeople from owning gold, with the exception of jewelry and certain collector’s \\ncoins. \\nWe think Bitcoin falls short of other ‘stores -of-value’ in two ways.  First, Bitcoin has \\na limited histo ry as a store of value ,having only been created in 2009.  Gold has \\nbeen used as a store of value for a t least 5,000 years and more likely at least 7,000 \\nyears as that is w hen the first know gold mine was active. Bitcoin is also volatile, \\nwith price volatility levels materially higher than other asset classes including gold, \\nthe US$, equities and commodities. Because of the evaluated price volatility versus \\nother asset classes, Bitcoin would likely not make a good currency as hi gher \\nvolatility  could u ndermine crypto as a medium of exchange, as a unit of account and \\nas a standard for deferred payments, the other recognized functions of money.  But \\neven concerns over higher volatility have been met with Bitcoin support because \\nBitcoin has been an appreci ating asset, volatile for sure, but with significant value \\nappreciation. \\nFigure 9: Bitcoin Much More Volatile than Traditional Asset Classes \\nSource: J.P.

Morgan estimates.\\nThe Transition to Ethereum\\nWhile the technology backing bitcoin is significant, we see the use cases for Bitcoin \\nas rather one-dimensional.  Bitcoin represents digital scarcity and therefore digital \\nvalue.  But cryptocurrencies made a leap beyond digital value with the development \\nof Ethereum.  If Bitcoin is digital value, Ethereum is a digital canvas or software \\nplatform that allows developers to create new crypto and traditional applications. Its \\nuse cas es are far more significant than what we see for Bitcoin.\\nEthereum and Smart Contracts –Stage 2 \\n–dApps T ake Form\\nEthereum was launched in 2014 and it has become a further evolution in \\nthedesign of and thinking about cryptocurrency networks. It is a more funct ional and \\ngeneral computation protocol that draws upon concepts from Bitcoin to \\ncreate application -based blockchain transactions, meaning it provides more functions \\nthan just account -based sending and receiving. It utilizes blockchain technology  not \\nonly for maintaining a decentralized pay ment network but also for storing computer \\ncode that can be used to power tamper -proof decentralized financial contracts and \\napplicati ons.  So while Bitcoin is characterized as a virtual decentralized currency  \\nbest recognized as a store of value, Ethereum is a decentralized software platform \\noff of which developers leverage smart contracts to develop decentralized \\napplications and fungible/non -fungible tokens. \\nHistory of Ethereum –Building on the Base Created by \\nBitcoin\\nEthereum was created by Vitalik Buterin in 2014. (Here is a link to his w hite \\npaper Ethereum white paper published in 2013.)  Ethereum is the blockchain and \\nEther (Eth) is the token, although most refer to Ether as Eth. Vitalik became \\ninterested in Bitcoin in 2011, co -founded Bitcoin Magazine in September of that year \\nand remained immersed in all topics Bitcoin for two years. He wrote his Ethereum \\nwhite paper in Nov 2013 to build Ethereum as a blockchain based platform that could \\nbe programm ed for many more applications than what Bitcoin could do as a peer -to-\\npeer currency.

Morgan. (1/3/21)\\nThe Workings of Ethereum\\nWhile Bitcoin is positioned as a digital currency based on scarcity value, Ethereum is \\nprogrammable blockchain that is the base of many other fungible and non -fungible \\ntokens. It is often referred to as the ‘chai n-of-chains’ because it is the base -chain or \\nbuilding block for other tokens. Like other cryptocurrencies, Ethereum works on a \\nblockchain network and is therefore a decentralized, distributed public ledger on \\nwhich transactions are recorded and verified. L ike Bitcoin, Ethereum utilizes the \\nproof -of-work protocol to validate its blockchain. But there are some key differences \\nbetween Bitcoin and Ethereum. Ether block time is faster (Ether transactions are \\nconfirmed in seconds while Bitcoin transactions take m inutes). Ether uses a different \\nprocessing algorithm with Bitcoin transactions run off the SHA -256 and Ethereum \\nEtash. While Ethereum currently runs on proof -of-work, it will convert to proof -of-\\nstake mid -2022, a change that we expect could alter the crypt ocurrency  landscape, as \\nwe discuss further below.\\nA most significant difference between Bitcoin and Ethereum is that Ethereum is \\nprogrammable and the Ethereum network can perform computations. It is this \\ncomputatio nal capability that turns what is a store of value and medium of exchange \\nfor Bitcoin into a global computing engine and openly verifiable data store in \\nEthereum. Ethereum as a programmable network allows for self -executing contracts \\n(smart contracts) with agreements programmed right into the Ethe reum blockchain.\\nEthereum operates under and benefits from three characteristics:\\n\\uf0b7Large Decentralized Network –Ethereum is the largest cryptocurrency \\necosystem and has a significant community committed to the protocol. As such \\nthere are significant number s of smart contracts that have already been written \\nand vetted by blockchain engineers in Solidity (Ethereum’s programming \\nlanguage) that can be integrated or expanded into new blockchain solutions. In \\naddition, Ethereum h as been tested with billions of do llars of transactio nsand \\nthus operates with significant credibility .This draws even more programmers \\nand users to the Ethereum network.   $bn$100bn$200bn$300bn$400bn$500bn$600bn$700bn$800bn$900bnMarket Cap of Top 20 Coins16North A merica Equity Research\\n10 January 2022Kenneth B.

Ethereum’s decentralized \\nnetwork promises to let users leave behind third -party intermediaries, like \\nlawy ers who write and interpret contracts, banks that are intermediaries in \\nfinancial transactions or third -party web hosting services.\\n\\uf0b7Upgrades of the Functionality ‒A large community of Ethereum developers is \\nlooking for ways to improve the network and develop new applications. \\nEthereum is an evolving blockchain. Recent upgrade s(discussed in a separate \\npiece of research on the London Hard Fork )introd uced the ability to burn tokens \\nand limit Ethereum mining driv en inflation, for example .  However, the most \\nradical change is expected mid-2022 when Ethereum is expected to migrate from \\nProof -of-Work to Proof -of-Stake . \\nEthereum –the Chain of Chains Drives New Applications \\nBecause Ethereum is programmable, there ar e significant applications that have been \\ndeveloped using the Ethereum technology.  This begins with sm art contracts through \\nto dApps and fungible/non -fungible tokens.  We see five general uses for Ethereum.\\n\\uf0b7Currency: Similar to Bitcoin, you can send and receive Eth or pay for goods \\nand services. As such, Eth (Ether) can be a store of value. \\n\\uf0b7Smart contracts: Ethereum allows for the development of smart contracts, \\npermissionless applications that automatically execute when the contract’s \\nconditio ns have been met.  It is these smart -contracts that are the basis for the \\nother applications described below.  \\n\\uf0b7Digital apps, or dApps :Ethereum powers digital apps that allow users to play \\ngames, invest, send money, track an i nvestment portfolio, follow social media \\nand more. Currently, over 440,000 ERC -20 tokens have been developed on \\nEthereum. \\n\\uf0b7Non-fungible tokens :The majority of NFTs are p owered by Ethereum and can \\nallow artists or others to sell art or other items directly to buyers using smart \\ncontracts. NFTs are ERC -721, non -fungible tokens. The bonus here is that one \\ncan build a royalty structure right into the blockchain, empowering th e content \\ncreator.\\n\\uf0b7Decentralized finance: By using Ethereum, some people may be able to avoid \\ncentralized (government, bank) control ove r the movement of money or other \\nassets. DeFi is trying to put the central functions of financial services companies \\non the blockchain, essentially cutting out the bank/broker/exchange as the \\nfinancial intermediary with the promise of greater speed, lower cost and greater \\nsecurity . \\nSmart Contracts on Ethereum \\nSmart contracts are the base on which dApps , NFTs and DeFi are created. A smart \\ncontract refers to a piece of computer program that gets executed by a quorum of \\nblockchain nodes and often facilitate the exchange of money, share or property. At \\ntheir core, smart contracts are executable programs used to automate the ex ecution of \\nan agreement on the blockchain without the need for intermediaries. 17North A merica Equity Research\\n10 January 2022Kenneth B. W orthington, CFA\\n(1-212) 622 -6613\\nkenneth.b.worthington@jpmorgan.com\\n     \\n          \\nSmart contracts are essentially automated agr eements, written in code and baked into \\nthe blockchain, making them immutable as well as irreversible. They contain terms \\nand condi tions of a mutually agreed contract and can define rules like a regular \\ncontrac t, but that is automatically enforced via the code. Smart contracts are not \\nlegally  binding the way traditional contracts are. Yet, smart contracts are powerful \\nbecause they can increase the speed, accuracy, and integrity in payment and \\nperformance transac tions.  Once executed, the smart contract cannot be altered. Yet \\nthe ability for Ethereum to support the development of smart contracts is key in the \\nfurther development of Decentralized Applications including fungible and non -\\nfungible tokens and ultimatel y decentralized finance , discussed further below. \\nIn Figure 12 below, we show that smart contracts are based on program functions, \\nwith inputs processed to create outputs. The logic inside smart contracts determine if \\na transaction is valid, with valid tr ansactions result ingin updated blockchain state, \\nwith invalid transactions rejected by the network from being included. The example \\nof an invalid transaction would be the spending of tokens without a sufficient \\nbalance. \\nFigure 12: Smart Contracts\\nSource: Kaleido.\\nFigure 13: Smart Contracts\\nSource: Ethereum.org and J.P.

The number of dApps \\nhasgotten big with more than 3600 dApps spanning different industries such as \\ngaming, financial services and social media. They are growing in relevan ceand are \\nestimated to be responsible for nearly $200 billion worth (and growing) of user \\ntransactions annually. \\ndApps are decentralized applications, similar to normal apps ,but run on peer -to-peer \\nnetworks like blockchains.  As such, dApps are open -sourc e and operate without one \\nentity  controlling its data , with records that are publicly available and use a \\ncryptographic token to keep the network secure.  dApps are built by combining a \\nuser interface front -end and smart contract back -end.  \\ndApp =Front-end+Smart Contract Back-end\\nIn dApps , the fro nt-end can be programmed in any language, but w ill call aback-end \\nwritten into the blockchain.  In terms of front -end user experience, dApps appear \\nnearly  identical to tradit ionalweb applications. However on the back -end, dApps\\nfunction much differently than their conventional counterparts. Instead of employing \\nthe HTTP protocol to communicate with the b roader network, dApps connect to the \\nblockchain in a decentralized manner rather than routing through cen tralized servers. \\nWe see the power of dApps is their decentralization, which makes them both free \\nfrom cens orship and easier to create. dApps are characterized by:\\n\\uf0b7Open source : The code is public for anyone to look at, copy and audit.\\n\\uf0b7Decentralization : dApps don’t have anyone in charge, so no central authority \\ncan stop users from doing what they want on the app.\\n\\uf0b7No Downtime: After deploying thesmart contract ontheblockchain, the\\nnetwork canalways serve theneeds ofclients whowant tointeract with the\\nsmart contract. Furthermore, dApps canalsoensure thatanymalicious actors\\ncannot launch denial -of-service attacks onspecific apps.

Ethereum makes dApp \\ndevelopment easier by offering a development interface that reduces programming \\ntime and helps projects quickly launch. In addition, the Ethereum developer \\ncommunity has grown significant ly since the platform’s launch with a network that \\nshares code and ideas. Ethereum also retains formidable network effects from its \\nglobal coalition of technologists who remain committed to maintaining the network \\nand actively developing user resources tha t drive adoption. The ability to monetize \\nDApp projects incentivizes others to par take in the Ethereum ecosystem.\\nEthereum also uses a network -native language Solidity for coding smart contracts. \\nBut the network architecture eliminates the need to develop an entirely new \\nblockchain for ever y dApp. Once a smart contract is created, it is uploaded to the \\nEthereum Virtual Machine (EVM) ,which is a runtime compiler that executes the \\nsmart contract code. EVM is operated in what is called a ‘sandbox’ environment ,\\nwhich is isolated from the main n etwork to create an optimal testing environment. \\nOnce the code is on the EVM, everyone part of the Ethereum network has a copy of \\nthe contract. Once the smart contract is tested and verified ,it is uploaded to the \\nEthereum Mainnet.  \\nDevelopers can work with the ready -made Ethereum system to fast -track o nboarding \\nand get their applications up and running sooner than other alternatives. By \\ncombining application templates and the EVM, the overall Ethereum development \\nkit allo ws companies to focus on refining their applications and developing on top of \\nopen -source code among a global, mission -based developer community.\\ndApps and Tokenization\\nWe see tokenization as one of the major foundations of Ethereum. Tokenization is a \\nfeature used to define smart contracts and is acore element in dApps. But when we \\nrefer to tokens, there are two standards that have emerged on Ethereum ‒ERC -20 \\nand ERC -721. (The ERC stands for Ether eum Request for Comment, which i s the \\nsystem that allows for comments onthe standardization of Ethereum tokens and \\nfeatures a standard set of rules for creating tokens. ) As we reflect back, we see a \\nnumber of references to 2021 as the year of the NFT. To us, it is just the beginning of \\ntokenization. \\nERC -20 vs. E RC-721 Tokens\\nThere are two main token standards for Ethereum tokens.  At their most basic level, \\nERC -20 tokens are fungible tokens and are used for all smart contracts on the \\nEthereum blockchain.  Examples include BinanceCoin (BNB) ,the fourth largest \\ntoken by  market cap at $78bn, Stablecoins Tether and USDC ,which have a \\ncombined market cap of $ 121bn.  ERC -721 are non -fungible tokens (NFTs) ,which\\narea type of unique digital certificate, registered on a blockchain that can be used to \\nrecord ownership of any asset, best known for digital collectibles. While ERC -20 \\ntokens represent a single asset and are interchangeable, ERC -721 tokens are \\nindivisible and represent a collection of assets. Examples here including \\nCryptoKitti es, Etheremons, Crypto Bots, and B lockchain Cuties.20North A merica Equity Research\\n10 January 2022Kenneth B.

ERC -20 \\ntokens are built on the Ether eum blockchain and adhere to a set of standards that \\nallow the tokens to work with all other Ethereum smart contracts, enabling the \\nexchange of one ERC -20 token for another and allowing the easy i ntegration with \\nother smart c ontracts, wallets, or marketplace s. ERC -20 smart contracts use ERC -20 \\ntokens to make payments when their protocol calls for it. Any smart contract that \\ninvolves pa yments will therefore pay the user in the for m of an ERC -20 token. \\nMany  dApps built o n Ethereum have their own cryptocurrencies or “tokens.” As of \\nAugust, there were over 440,000 ERC -20 tokens on Ethereum’s main network across \\nmore than 900 projects.  ERC -20 tokens are typically sold via a variety o f different \\nofferings as a way to raise early -stage capital for the underlying project. Many of the \\nprojects raised money in the initial coin offering boom of 2017.\\n21North A merica Equity Research\\n10 January 2022Kenneth B.

T here are three types of blockchain -based tokens that we will discuss:\\n\\uf0b7Usage tokens: A token that is required to use a service. These are the tokens that \\nfunction like a currency in their respective dApps. This is generally th e most \\nsimple and straightforward application of a token. These tokens have monetary \\nvalue , but don’t come with any sort of rights or privilege within the particular \\nnetwork.\\n\\uf0b7Work tokens: A token that gives users the right to contribute work to a DAO \\nand e arn in exchange for their work. In this model, the user (or service provider) \\nstakes the native token of the network to earn the right to perform work for the \\nnetwork. Given a fixed supply of tokens, service providers will rationally pay \\nmore per token for the right to earn part of a growing cash flow stream. The \\nimportant thing to understand at this stage is that work tokens grant access to the \\nnetwork and provide cash flow potential conditional on the deliver y of work \\nwith the token .\\n\\uf0b7Security tokens: An external, tradable asset that is a representation of value in a \\nsystem. Security  tokens, also known as tokenized securities or investment \\ntokens, are financial securities compliant with SEC regulations. What makes \\nsecurity tokens so neat (and potentially re volutionary) is that the rights are \\nwritten into a smart contract and the tokens are traded o n a blockchain -powered \\nexchange –24/7/365 with near instant settlement.\\n22North A merica Equity Research\\n10 January 2022Kenneth B.

In return, investors receive newly minted tokens \\nprior to the official launch at wholesale prices.\\n\\uf0b7Voting rights: Tokens can be used for voting on project decisions. In this \\ninstance, the more tokens users have ,the more influence they have over each \\nelection.\\n\\uf0b7Represent physical objects: Atoken can represent ownership of assets, such as \\ngold.\\n\\uf0b7New features: Sometimes builders need a token for paying for the functionality \\nof their projects, but the native token on Ethereum, Eth, is not enough for them. \\nSo, they  create a new token with the fu nctionality they need.\\nERC -721 T okens --NFTs\\nThe ERC -721 Token standard enables Non -Fungible Tokens (NFTs) on the Ethereum \\nblockchain. J ust like the ERC -20 token standard helps in creating fungible tokens, the \\nERC -721 focuses on non -fungible asset s. ERC -721 tokens help bring the concept of \\nuniqueness to the blockchain, ensuring that distinctive details about an asset can be \\nimmortalized. NFTs can be used to provide digital representation of a one -of-a-kind \\nartwork, with ownership that is easily proved thro ugh blockchain records and can \\nlimit things like counterfeiting.\\nThe Ethereum Foundation describes the workings of an NFT like this.  An NFT has \\none owner at a time, which is managed through the uniqueID and metadata that no \\nother token can replicate. NFTs are minted through smart contracts that assign \\nownership and manage the transferability. When an NFT is created, the creator \\nexecutes code stored in smart contracts that conform to a certain standard, such as \\nERC -721, and th is information is added to the blockchain where the NFT is being \\nmanaged. The minting process, from a high level, has the following ste ps that it goes \\nthrough:\\n\\uf0b7Creating a new block$bn$50bn$100bn$150bn$200bn$250bn$300bn$350bn$400bn$450bn$500bn\\n4Q18 2Q19 4Q19 2Q20 4Q20 2Q21 4Q21Market Cap of ETH vs  25 Largest ERC -20 Tokens\\nEthereum Top 2523North A merica Equity Research\\n10 January 2022Kenneth B.

While we discuss the implications later in \\nthe note, some key properties are as follows.  \\n1.Each NFT has a unique identifier that is directly linked to one Ethereum \\naddress.\\n2.NTFs are not directly interchangeable with other tokens 1:1. For example 1 \\nETH is exactly the same as another ETH. This isn\\'t the case with NFTs. \\n3.Each token has an owner and this information is easily verifiable.  Here, the \\ntoken proves that the copy of t he digital file is the original and the private \\nkey is proof -of-ownership of the original.  The content creator\\'s public key \\nserves as a certificate of authenticity for that particular NFT. \\n4.They  live on Ethereum and can be bought and sold on any Ethereum -based \\nNFT market.\\nCurrent use cases for NFTs are in digital entertainment including art and music, but\\nare increasingly being used as assets in gaming. We expect NFTs will become a key \\npart of DeFi with the tokenization of particular value for ill iquid assets.  Below we \\nshow a compare and contrast between the current internet and an NFT internet, \\nwhich is presented by the Ether eum Organization. \\nTable 1: The NFT Internet vs. the Internet Today –A Compare and Contrast\\nAn NFT Internet The Internet Today\\nNFTs are digitally unique, no two NFTs are the \\nsame.A copy of a file, like an .mp3 or .jpg is the same as \\nthe original.\\nEvery NFT must have an owner and this is of public \\nrecord and easy for anyone to verify.Ownership records of digital items are stored on \\nservers controlled by institutions -you must take their \\nword for it.\\nNFTs are compatible with anything built using \\nEthereum.

Morgan.\\nThe Downside of Ethereum –Getting More Congested and \\nExpensive \\nEthereum’s success and popularity have created a number of problems for the \\nnetwork. With increasing numbers of fungible and non -fungible tokens running on \\nEthereum, network congestion have driven gas prices /transaction fees to rise \\nmaterially for Ether eum based transactions, making it expensive to transact on the \\nnetwork. It can regularly cost $40 -$50 per transaction, making the purchase of simple \\nNFTs or th e movement of Ethereum from one wallet to another an expensive \\nproposition. Ethereum is also energy intensive and doesn\\'t communicate well with \\nother blockchains. It\\'s a bit like having a cellphone that can only textusers o n the \\nsame network. Ultimately E thereum’s problem has been its limited ability to scale \\nwith the increasing popularity of the network. \\nLack of Scalability\\nOne of the core problems with the Ethereum platform has been scalability. As more \\nand more decentralized apps use the platform, and transactions increase \\nexponentially, so do the gas fees. Simply put, if there are too many users on the \\nblockchain, it gets more expensive to buy and sell things.\\nIncrease Cost to Transact on Ethereum –Rising Transaction Costs\\nEthereum’s growing popularit y has led to higher transaction costs. Ethereum \\ntransaction fees, also known as “gas,” have been rising for much of 2021 . When we \\ntried to buy NFTs for the kids for presents this holiday season, weended up paying \\nmore in gas fees than in NFT prices.  Whil e in Bitcoin the network itself rewards \\ntransaction verifiers, Ethereum requires those participating in the transaction to cover \\nthe fee.  In Ethereum\\'s current state, only those with larger holdings can make use of \\nthe benefits of its ecosystem. Swapping cryptocurrencies on Uniswap, a \\ndecentralized exchange and liquidity provider on Ethereum\\'s network, costs nearly  \\n$150 earlier this year, making trading small amounts of money impractical .$1mn $6mn $18mn$13bn\\n$bn$2bn$4bn$6bn$8bn$10bn$12bn$14bn\\n2018 2019 2020 2021OpenSea Transaction Volume25North A merica Equity Research\\n10 January 2022Kenneth B.

Processing transactions on Ethereum network requires computational \\npower and gas is the fee paid to miners for providing that computational power. Gas \\nfees are measured in Gwei, the smallest base unit of ETH ‒1/1,000,000,000 of an \\nETH . Gas fees were created to both compensate and incentivize the miners to \\nundertake the computational costs of using the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) to \\nexecute the transaction.  But Gas fees also help keep the Ethereum network secure. \\nAttaching cost to every transaction prevents spamming or accidental infinity loops \\nthat could un intentionally or maliciously con sume the resources of Ethereum and \\nprevent new transactions from being recorded. More complex transactions require \\nmore gas to execute, with t ransactions involving smart contracts costing more than \\ntransfers of ETH between two wallets. Average daily gas prices in Dec 2021 have \\nranged from a low of $62 on Dec 19 to a high of $156 on Dec 4. Because transaction \\nfees need to be paid in Eth, particip ants on the Ethereum blockchain need to acquire \\nETH ,which results in value for ETH.\\nFigure 18: Eth Gas Prices Remains High\\nSource: ycharts.com\\nEthereum Suffers from Slower Transaction Speeds\\nEthereum runs at 15 transactions per second. This is faster than Bitcoin’s 7tps, but is \\nsubstantially slower than the Mas terCard’s network, for example that can process \\n5,000tps. Ethereum transaction speeds are being hurt by a number of factors \\nincluding greater data store needs given the inc reased usage of Ethereum and the \\nneed to drive consensus with an increasing number of nodes. The Blockchain \\ntrilemma reflects the tradeoffs between scalability, security and speed.

While the number of bitcoin tokens \\nis capped at 21mn , the number of Ethereum tokens had been rising at an ~4.7% \\nannual inflation rate (2020 inflation rate) ,driven by mining rewards at 2 ETH/block. \\nHowever, with the release of EIP -1559 (explained further below), ETH is now being \\nburned as part of ever y Ethereum transaction and thus the rate of inflation has fallen \\nto 1.7%. Following the Ethereum merge, there is the potential for ETH deflation. \\nSolutions for Ethereum’s Challenges –The Cryptoecosystem \\nAddresses Ethereum Network Issues, One Way or Another\\nThe p roblems with Ethereum are frustrating its user base, enough to drive them to \\naction.  Alternatives have been developed that include both the creation of new \\nblockchains that attempt to address Ethereum’s speed and congestion issues. We \\nhave also seen Layer -2 solutions (both Ethereum Layer -2 and other chain Layer -2) \\nincluding sidechains and other rollups that are bridges to address Ethereum’s \\nscalability issues.  Finally, Ethereum is a blockchain that continues to evolve and the \\nEthereum merge scheduled for mid-2022 is expected to address scalability issues. \\nLaunch of Other Programmable Blockchains –Other Layer -1 Solutions\\nThe cry ptocurrency market is building on the innovations developed with Ethereum \\nby launching other blockchains that address some of Ethereum’s shortcomings. \\nThese are underlying main blockchains, also known as Layer -1 chains. Ethereum has \\nthe first -mover advantage over all other altcoins and smart chain platforms and is \\nrecognized as the biggest decentralized marketplace for financial apps, services, and \\ngames . However, crypto markets continue to evolve and so -called ‘Ethereum killers’ \\nare gaining popularity based on their improvements made versus Ethereum.  Solana \\nis much faster than Ethereum.

The upgrade, re ferred to as the Ethereum \\nMerge ,has been long delayed, but is expected to be executed mid -2022 and will \\nconvert Ethereum from a proof -of-work to proof -of-stake. It will ultimately set \\nEthereum for greater scalability, greater transaction speeds and lower transaction \\ncosts. \\nThe more immediate benefits of the merge come from the migration to the Proof -of-\\nStake protocol ,which will drive an immediate improvement in energy efficiency, \\ndecentralization and security. Over time, there is the potential for improvements \\nin transaction speeds from ~ 15 transactions per second today to potentially 100,000 \\nTPS, acc ording to Ethereum founder, Vitalik Buterin.

With other blockchains like B itcoin largely static with just one \\nupgrade in the last four years, Ethereum supports numerous upgrades.  Governance is \\ninformal for Ethereum and happens off -chain. Upgrades to the core Ethereum \\nblockchain are proposed via Ethereum Improvement Proposals (E IPs) that specify \\nnew features or processes for Ethereum. The Ethereum Foundation operates as a non-\\nprofit organization that promotes and supports research, developme nt, and education \\nto produce decentralized applications ,hosts a nallcoredevs call where E IPs are \\nproposed and debated. Participants on allcoredevs calls include develop ers from the \\nEthereum Foundation, researchers from other organizations (including Consensys, \\nNethermind, Sigma Prime, Prysematic Labs) and other volunteers.  EIPs are \\nconsidered , debated, championed, tested, and if all goes well are ultimately \\nimplemented on the Ethereum mainnet. \\nThere were four upgrades of the Ethereum blockchain in 2021, including Berlin in \\nApril, London in August, Altair in October, and Arrow Glacier in Decem ber. The \\nLondon Hark Fork included EIP -1559 that takes a portion of gas fees in Eth that \\nwere paid to miners and ‘burns’ them, thus eliminating supply of Eth and reducing \\ninflation.  EIP -1559 also incorporated variable block sizes that are up to 2x larger to \\nhelp with capacity issues.  The London upgrade included other proposals EIP -3554, \\nEIP-3529, EIP -3198 and EIP -3541 that will help facilitate the transition to proof -of-\\nstake and the Ethereum merge expected in mid -2022.\\nWhat Is Happening in the Ethereum M erge \\nThe Ethereum merge refe rs to merger between the current Ethereum mainnet (PoW) \\nwith the Ethereum Beacon Chain (PoS).

When Ethereum \\nconverts to proof -of-stake, the sel ection process to validate the blockchain will \\nmigrate f rom solving the cryptographic puzzles to token ownership. Those that \\nown mo re Ethereum and/or own it longer will have a greater chance of adding \\nblocks to the Ethereum blockchain and earn a reward.  T he software required to \\nvalidate an Ethereum block in proof -of-stake can be done on a laptop with \\nexpected electricity costs of $150/year.  The proof -of-work protocol used to \\nvalidate the Bitcoin and Ethereum blockchains consumes significant energy as \\nmine rs seek to calculate the nonce. Currently Ethereum mining is estimated to \\nconsume ~44.5TWh/year in aggregate, on the magnitude of the energy Honduras \\nconsumed in 2016. \\n2)Ethereum scalability –Ethereum 2.0 plans to scale its capacity by using a \\nmethod calle d sharding, that is hoped/expected will greatly increase \\ntransaction speeds, potentially scaling its ability to 100,000 transactions per \\nsecond or more. Sharding is a way to partition a database into smaller pieces , \\nspreading execution into 64 new shard ch ains that are more manageable. With a \\nPoW blockchain, most nodes, or co mputers in the network, have an entire copy \\nof the history of transactions. This entire history can take up a lot of space, \\nespecially  for older cryptocurrencies with a long history of transactio ns. With \\nsharding on PoS, the blockchain is cut up into parallel sections, and nodes are \\nassigned to one section instead of having to hold the entirety of the chain\\'s data. \\nThis allows more transactions to be processed simultaneously, greatly in creasing \\nthroughput and transaction speed. Sharding is expected a fter the Ethereum \\nmerge, toward year-end 2022 or 2023. \\n3)Ethereum Deflation –We believe that Ethereum issuance could be deflationary \\nfollowing the merge. Inflation take splace when new tokens are mined (in the \\ncase of proof -of-work) or minting (in the case of proof -of-stake) as part of the \\nrewards given to those that are adding blocks and validating the blockchains. \\nHowever, we estimate that the migration from proof -of-work to proof -of-stake \\ncombined with the burn introduced in EIP -1559 could drive Ethereum to \\ndeflation and negative token issuance. We estimate that Ethereum’s inflation rate \\nwas ~4.2% annually prior to the implementation of EIP -1559. Block rewards of \\n2 Eth for mining Ethereum blocks resulted in ~13,000Eth created each day \\n@2eth x 6,500 blocks/day.  However, EIP-1559 is driving Eth to be burne d \\n(taken out of existence) as a portion of the gas fee is now burnt rather than paid \\nto the miner s.  We note that s ince the introduction of EIP -1559, Eth issuance has \\ndeclined 66% and when transaction activity is particularly elevated, Eth can be \\ndeflationary . \\nTable 2: Burned Rewards since the Introduction of EIP -1559 through Jan 3, 2022\\nETH USD Equivalent\\nBurned 1,342,310 $4,964,190,183\\nRewards 2,031,053 $7,511,321,476\\nTips 249,467 $922,587,702\\nNet Issuance 688,743 $2,547,138,435\\nSource: watchtheburn.com and J.P.

But it also means that with far lower block rewards under \\nproof -of-stake that the burn will likely result in deflation, which depending on \\ntransaction levels and g as-prices could burn 1 -2mn Eth/year. \\nWhat\\'s Next for CryptoCurrencies\\nWe think it important to think about outlook for the cryptomarkets based on use \\ncases and potential.

Our understanding is that NFTs \\ntransformed Art Basil in Miami this past December.  But the utilization of NFTs \\nseems likely at its early stages and we see financial services as holding great \\npotential for tokenization broadly.  Some use cases f or NFTs areas follows. \\n33North A merica Equity Research\\n10 January 2022Kenneth B.

Morgan\\nGaming –The development of games take a bit longer than art or music, and we \\nexpect gaming will use NFTs in a much bigger way.  Concepts like play -to-earn are \\ndeveloping with NFTs as the assets in the games. Given the interoperability of \\nEthereum based tokens, we would expect ERC -721 to be the more likely standard \\nutilized in the early development of these game s.\\nNFTs as Tickets –NFTs can be the ticket to a concert, the memento, and the key to \\nunlocking backstage access all in one, but also automatically takes the ticket \\nproceeds and divides them between the artist, the crew, the venue. While the ticket \\ncan be made exclusive to cut out the scalpers, tickets that can be resold can \\nautomatically allocate any increase in ticket price on resale to the artist, crew and \\nvenue so that the content creators benefit from the upside.  I’m sure there will be \\nmore interestin g applications over time. \\nNFTs in the Metaverse –The metaverse canbe a place to store and appreciate NFT \\nart, it’s a hub for gaming, it’s a virtual reality world.  Like gaming, NFTs are \\npositioned to be the assets in the metaverse, with Ethereum as its currency. \\nTokenization of Ever ything. –Tokenization would seem to hold great potential for \\nfinancial services, in particular for illiquid assets that could benefit from price \\ndiscover y, liquidity , asset servicing, and asset composition. Settlement times for \\nequities at T+2 and for credit settlement is T+10+ , with som e products as long as \\nT+40 would benefit from tokenization. While transaction speeds are too slow for the \\nliquid products, there is the advantage of 24/7/365 trading, in addition to the risk \\nmitigation (and capital relief) that comes with near instant settlement. In our future \\nwe see the tokenization (and fractionalization) of credit, equities, parts of real estate \\n(commercial to residential to hotel rooms), and non -traded investments including\\nprivate equity.\\nDeFi –The Value of Crypto in Decentralized Finance\\nDecentralized Finance appears as a large opportunity for cryptomarkets to both \\nparticipate in and in some cases to disintermediate traditional finance. DeFi is \\nattempting to replicate ma ny or most of the products and services offered by banks, \\nincluding borrowing, lending, buying insurance, trading derivatives, buying assets, \\n34North A merica Equity Research\\n10 January 2022Kenneth B. W orthington, CFA\\n(1-212) 622 -6613\\nkenneth.b.worthington@jpmorgan.com\\n     \\n          \\nand earning interest. The existing financial system in the US has functioned for more \\nthan a century and operates under a regulatory framework that has been in place \\nsince the 1930s and 1940s.  DeFi is offering many of the same products and services \\nas traditio nal financial services firm s, but offers them in an updated framework, with \\nthe opportunity to operate faster and more efficiently in crypto’s peer -to-peer \\nnetwork rather than through system of independent companies and entities.  While \\nDeFi inherits many of Ethereum’s problems such as speed and cost, we see these \\nproblems as solvable and thus see DeFi as present ing a possibly more efficient \\nframework to offer financial services in the future. \\nFigure 24: Traditional Finance and its Decentralized Finance Challenger\\nSource: Consensys .\\nTrad Finance Has Excesses\\nOur traditional financial system today has more intermediaries than it probably \\nneeds.  Compare a trade in traditional finance to one for cryptocurrencies. In \\ntraditional finance, parties involved in a trade include the mobile app, the broker, the \\nmarket m aker, the exchange, the prime broker, the clearing house, custodian and \\ntransfer agent for the buyer and those same financial participants for the seller.  In the \\ncryptoecosystem when transacting with a token, there is the buyer, the intermediary \\nand the s eller.  In the cryptoecosystem, out of necessity and/or by design, the \\nintermediaries are vertically integrated. \\nExamples of DeFi today\\nThere are a number of examples where DeFi is permeating financial services. \\n\\uf0b7Lending : Lend out your crypto and ea rn int erest and rewards ever y minute –not \\nonce per month. Lending is based on the c ollateralization of crypto assets by \\nlocking them in smart contracts and borrowing against that collateral . Interest \\npayments, maturity  and lifecycle processes are all automated through the \\nprotocol .  It is estimated that $52bn is the value currently locked in lending \\nprotocols such as AAVE and Compound. \\n\\uf0b7Getting a loan: Obtain a loan instantly without filling in paperwork, including \\nextremely  short -term “flash loans” that traditional financial institutions don’t \\noffer.\\n35North A merica Equity Research\\n10 January 2022Kenneth B. W orthington, CFA\\n(1-212) 622 -6613\\nkenneth.b.worthington@jpmorgan.com\\n     \\n          \\n\\uf0b7Making a Payment: Decentralized payment tools designed to facilitate invoicing \\nand pay ments between merchants and customers. Here, d igital -native assets \\nstand out from legacy digital payment methods, such as those run by Visa and \\nPayPal, in that they remove all middlemen from transactions. When you pay \\nwith a credit card for coffee at a cafe, a financial institution sits between you and \\nthe business, with control over the transaction, retaining the authority t o stop or \\npause it and record it in its private ledger. By paying in cryptocurrencies, those \\ninstitutions could be cut out of the picture.  There is ~$3bn of value locked in \\ndecentralized payments in protocols such as Salier. \\nStablecoins : Another form of DeFi is the stablecoin. Cryptocurrencies often \\nexperience sharper price fluctuations than fiat. Stablecoi ns peg cryptocurrencies to \\nnon-cryptocurrencies, such as the US dollar, in order to keep the price under control. \\nWith the ability to send crypto like money, cyptocurrencies could alter the remittance \\nmarkets , B2B payments and cross -border money transfers.  While some see the \\ninterchange -fees charged by credit card companies as being at risk, this is not \\nconsidered the base case for the J.P. Morgan payme nts team. An example of DeFi in \\nstablecoins is Maker, a platform that collateralizes assets to create a stablecoin. \\nTrading : Non -custodial automated market making protocols running a decentralized \\norderbook.  Here, order matching and price -setting can be done completely \\nalgorithmically, allowing peer -to-peer trades of certain crypto assets without any \\nkind of brokerage.  There is ~$31bn locked in Decentralized Exchanges such as \\nUniswap. \\nSaving for the future : Put some of your crypto into savings account a lternatives and \\nearn better interest rates than you’d typically get from a bank.\\nBuying derivatives : Tokenized derivatives created without the need for a third party.  \\nCounterparty agreements are programmatically encoded, reducing the risk for \\nmalicious a ctivity.   Make long or short bets on certain assets. Think of these as the \\ncrypto version of stock options or futures contracts. There is an estimated $4.1bn \\nlocked in DeFi derivative protocols such as Synthetix. 36North A merica Equity Research\\n10 January 2022Kenneth B.

DeFi is distinct because it \\nexpands the use of blockchain from simple value transfer to more complex \\nfinancial use cases. Cutting out middlemen from all kinds of transactions is one \\nof the primary  advantages of decentralized finance.\\n\\uf0b7Open: You don’t need to apply for anything or “open” an account. You just get \\naccess by creating a wallet.\\n\\uf0b7Pseudonon ymous: You don’t need to provide your name, email address, or any \\npersonal information.\\n\\uf0b7Flexible: You can move your assets anywhere at any time, without asking for \\npermission, waiting for long transfers to finish, and paying expensive fees\\n\\uf0b7Fast: Interest Rates and rewards often update rapidly (as quickly as every 15 \\nseconds), and can be signific antly  higher than traditional Wall Street.\\n\\uf0b7Transparent: Everyone involved can see the full set of transactions (private \\ncorporations rarely grant that kind of transparency) .\\n37North A merica Equity Research\\n10 January 2022Kenneth B.

As mentioned above, the \\ndownside is network congestion and the impact that has on increasing gas costs and \\ntransaction expenses.  As such, DeFi that results in active transactions ca n be very \\nexpensive.  Other issues such as token volatility, the need to monitor transactions for \\ntax purposes and varying regulation from one region to another are also highlighted \\nas risks to DeFi. \\nTraditional Financial Services Companies Start to Embra ce Cryptocurrency \\nTechnology.\\n\\uf0b7Traditional Financial Services firms are servicing clients that want to engage in \\nthe cry ptoecosystem.  There are also examples where financial firms are \\nembracing the cryptoecosystem to make traditional financial offerings be tter.  \\nHere, we see traditional financial services on the front -end, but DeFi powering \\nthe back -end.  However, we see the current regulatory environment (really the \\nlack of Federal Crypto Rules and Regulation) limiting the presence that \\ntraditional finance can have in crypto.  There is just too much to lose if new rules \\nare put into place that run contrary to the ways that traditional financial service \\nfirms might be engaging with crypto.

The Ether eum merge is expected mid-2022 ,which \\nwill drive much greater energy efficiently, and we expect will position the \\n‘chain -of-chains’ fora significant boost to capacity, transaction speed and \\nusability as we enter 2023.  If 2021 was the year of the NFT, we see 2022 \\nas possibly the year of the blockchain bridge (driving greater \\ninteroperability of various chains) or the year of financial tokenization. As \\nsuch, we see the cryptocurrency markets as increasingly relevant to \\nfinancial services. \\n\\uf0b7Bitcoin –Stage -1.Bitcoin leverages blockchain technology to create \\ndecentralized ownership of digital assets, leveraging the transparency of \\na digital l edger. (We continue to see this innovation as amazing.) Bitcoin \\nas a digital currency has value in that it is highly efficient to own and \\ntransact –anywhere in the world in 30 minutes or less. But its nature as a \\ndigital asset contains a number of attribu tes that makes Bitcoin valuable \\nas digital scarcity and as a better store of value often referred to a digital \\ngold. \\n\\uf0b7Ethereum –Stage -2.Ether eum is the evolution of cryptocurrencies to a \\nprogrammable blockchain, a network that performs computations. This \\nmakes Ether eum smart and turns the blockchain into a global computing \\nengine, secured and transparent. This is wher e the fun really begins \\nbecause this programmability allows the development of smart contracts, \\nwhich drives the creation of decentralized app s dApps and more . \\n\\uf0b7The Implications .The applications from crypto have only just begun. \\nWeb3.0, greater use of NFTs and tokenization are in the line-of-sight for \\n2022. As financial analyst s, we are most excited about the implications \\nfor financial services and see the tokenization and fractionalization as \\nholding particularly large prom ise as transactions speeds in crypto \\nbecome more competitive with trad-fi networks. DeFi was a bit of a flop \\nin 2021, but still has strong potential in 2022 and beyond. \\n\\uf0b7Coin base Is Still a Buy. This prim er indicates to us that the use cases for \\nthe cryptomarkets will continue to grow and new projects andtokens \\nwith more and different use cases will surface. With these projects \\nattached to tokens and Coinbase a leading exchange to buy and sell\\ntokens, we see Coinbase as a leading direct beneficiary of cryptomarket \\ngrowth. 2North A merica Equity Research\\n10 January 2022Kenneth B.

Regulators have also stepped up their engagement in 2H21, but we \\nthink the market will need more from Federal US regulators to maintain the \\ninnovation momentum. \\nFor investors who want to greater insights into the cryptomarkets and some of its \\ninner workings, we offer a 101 -primer with both a discussion on how the \\ncryptomarkets work, as well as the state of the cryptocurrency markets as we see \\nthem today.  We expect the evolution of the cryptomarkets could accelerate in 2022, \\nparticularly for financial services should the promise of greater capacity and \\ntransaction speeds be delivered by upgrades to layer -1 chain Ethereum and/or new \\nlayer-2 initiatives.  \\nOur takeaway continues to be that taking the time to better understand the \\ncryptoecosystem is worth the effort. We see the likelihood that the cryptoecosyst em \\nwill be much bigger at the end of the year than it is today, and will have permeated \\nfar more of traditional finance three years from now than it has currently.  As such \\nwe see both the likelihood of more winning business models and investment \\nopportuni ties, as well as businesses that have the potential to become \\ndisintermediated.  The leading caveat to our bullish outlook remains regulation and \\nour concern that bending the existing regulatory framework to adapt to the \\ncryptoecosystem could constrain the innovation needed to better develop the \\ncryptocurrency  markets here in the US. However, we see politicians as having a far \\nbetter understanding of the cryptomarkets at year -end 2021 than they did at the \\nbeginning, an understanding thatwe think is a key i ngredient to better regulation.   \\nEvolution of the CryptoEcosystem\\nFigure 1: Timeline of Key CryptoEcosystem Milestone sin Recent Years\\nSource: Onyx by JPMorgan\\nThe cry ptoecosystem is still early in its development, being only fourteen years since \\nSatoshi Nakamoto wrote his/her/their whitepaper that jumpstarted the development \\nof Bitcoin and whi ch ultimately gave way to other developments such as Ethereum, \\nsmart contracts, tokenization, NFTs, Web3.0 and the Metaverse.  \\n4North A merica Equity Research\\n10 January 2022Kenneth B. W orthington, CFA\\n(1-212) 622 -6613\\nkenneth.b.worthington@jpmorgan.com\\n     \\n          \\nFor thos e that are beginning their journey into the cryptoecosystem, there are some \\nconcepts that helped usbetter understand the value of cr yptocurrencies, which helped \\nusset a base off of which to more fully explore the cryptomarkets. \\n1)Cryptocurrencies are tech nology . While investors trade tokens like assets, \\ncryptomarkets are te chnology and the underlying use cases are a big driver \\nof their value.  This technology is also the basis for communities that \\ndevelop around cryptocurrency projects, but in our view the technology \\ncomes first and is more important to the initial value creation. \\n2)The tokens are linked to blockchains. Investors with whom we have spoken \\nare far more willing to ascribe value to blockchains than they are to \\ncryptocurrencies.  There is a more easily  accepted belief that blockchain \\ntechnology has value, w hile the digital tokens are a retail driven pyramid \\nscheme.  However, the tokens and the blockchains are linked.  \\nDecentralized blockchains need a token with value to incentivize the\\nvalidation of the blockchain ― there needs to be a token and that token \\nneeds to have value in both proof -of-stake and proof -of-work.  While this \\ntoken value will fluctuate with supply and demand and thus the tokens can \\nget overvalued, a token with value is nonethele ss a necessary component of \\na decentralized blockchain. \\n3)Token value is based on the use cases for the blockchain. The value of the \\ntoken is set by the market, based on supply and demand.  Transactions on a \\nblockchain are paid in the native token and thus one needs to purchase the \\nunderlying token to transact.  For example, ERC -721 tokens (also referred \\nto as NFTs) are bought and sold with Eth (Ether) and gas prices (transaction \\nfees) are also paid in Eth. Acquiring Eth to transact in Ethereum based \\nproject s drives up the value of the Ether token. \\nThe Evolution of the CryptoEcosystem\\nWe see the development of the cryptoecosystem happening in three stages: 1) \\nBitcoin, 2) Ethereum and Smart Contracts, and 3) Tokens and the Metaverse.  Each \\ndevelopmental stage builds on the prior and with each stage there are more \\nopportunities to create new engagement and more fulsome communities, and thus \\ndevelop incremental business and revenue opportunities that didn’t exist in the past. \\nWhile we expect disintermediation, w e see the cryptomarkets more about creating \\nnew opportunities for engagement and thus more new business opportunities.  (NFTs \\nin Art Basil Miami brought out new artists and new buyers, complementing rather \\nthan disintermediating the traditional art world, for example.)\\nWe view Bitcoin as being mature in its value proposition, although adoption could \\nstill grow quite materially.  Ethereum / Smart Contract devel opment and adoption \\nalso appear to us to be quite early and depending on the impact of the merge on\\ncapacity  and transaction costs could propel the protocol to permeate gaming, \\nfinancial services, real estate and other businesses and asset classes.  We see \\ntokenization (non -fungible tokens) and the Metaverse still a t their infancy.  While \\nNFTs have represented an evolution in the art world and seem poised to infiltrate and \\nalter the gaming industry, we see NFT s and tokenization in their infancy.  We still \\nsee Web3.0 and the Metaverse as ‘ in-development.’ \\nWith this in mind, we walk through the evolution of the cryptoecosystem in more of \\na chronological order as we see each stage building on the prior.  While many new to 5North A merica Equity Research\\n10 January 2022Kenneth B.

It operates a permissionless \\nand decentralized ledger on which all Bitcoin transactions are recorded. Anyone can \\njoin and interact with the Bitcoin blockchain , and Bitcoin users can send ‘value’ from \\none account or wallet to another in matter of minutes, without the involvement of a \\nbank or financial institution. Think about transactions as emailing value to anyone or \\nanyentity  anywhere in the world, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year. \\nInherent in the bitcoin software is a hard limit cap of 21 million coins. There will \\nnever be more than that in existence and based on the current pace of mining, it will \\ntake u ntil 2140 for all the bitcoin to make it into circulation. \\nThe History of Bitcoin Starts with a White Paper with an \\nUnknown Author\\nBitcoin was created following the release of a white paper by Satoshi Nakamoto\\nwhich created an incentive structure that le d to the creation of Bi tcoin . The digital \\ncurrency  was intended to provide an alternative payment system that would operate \\nfree of central control but otherwise be used just like traditional currenc ies.From \\nhere, it has grown to be a well -recognized store of value ,with a market capitalization \\nof $871bn (as of Jan -4).  \\nFigure 2: Market Capitalization of Bitcoin Surges in 2020/2021\\n$ billion\\nSource: Bloomberg Finance L .P.and  J .P.

Transactions are verified by a network of nodes \\n(computers) through cryptography, with transaction details recorded in a public \\ndistributed ledger, the blockchain. The blockchain is a linked body of data, made up \\nof units called blocks that contain information about each and ever y transaction, \\nincluding date, time, total value, buyer and seller, and a unique identifying code for $bn$200bn$400bn$600bn$800bn$1000bn$1200bn$1400bnBitcoin Market Cap6North A merica Equity Research\\n10 January 2022Kenneth B.

It is the digital ledger of th e transaction history that \\nenables digital ownership, which we see as the genius of the cryptomarkets. Blocks \\nare created approximately every 10 minutes and contain approximately 500 \\ntransactions per block.  Bitc oin operates at ~7 TPS (transactions per sec ond), very \\nslow in terms of financial services.

By seeing the steps involved in such a \\ntransfer, we think it helps in better understanding the cryptoecosystem. \\nUnderstanding Pu blic and Private Keys –The Keys to Cryptography\\nThe transfer of bitcoin from one person to another utilizes p ublic and private keys, \\nintegral parts of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. These keys work in combination \\nto allow participants to send and rec eive cr yptocurrency without requiring a third \\nparty  like a bank to verify the transactions.

In addition, the sender \\nPerso n-1 will also include a mining fee that is measured in Satoris/vbyte, with \\nthe average transaction 250bytes and thus the typical fee $76 or ~15bps. \\n4.The wallet will communicate the transaction details to a node, which is any \\ncomputer (a simple PC/laptop) t hat sto res the entire bitcoin blockchain.  As of \\nthe writing of this note, there are ~12,000 bitcoin nodes that are all \\ninterconnected, and communicate with all the other nodes in the network and \\nvalidate the transaction. \\n5.Nodes will hold the verified Bitc oin transactions in a mempool (waiting area for \\nbitcoin transactions). Here, miners that have solved the complex cryptographic \\nhash puzzle (discussed in more detail later in the note) will pick up the validated \\nbitcoin transactions. Because a mempool might store 3mbs of transaction data \\nand because each bitcoin block only holds 1mb of data , the miner will s ort the \\ntransaction in the mempool typically  by the mining fee, and will add these \\nhigher fee transactions to the block and will collect both the mining fee and the \\nmining reward (6.25 bitcoin). Once the transaction is reported to the b lock, the \\ntransaction is complete. \\nAs seen in the process above, a higher transaction fee will lead to faster execution \\nsince itis more profitable for the miner.  If the m ining fee is below average, the \\ntransaction could be sorted to the bottom of the mempool and may wait unconfirmed \\n8North A merica Equity Research\\n10 January 2022Kenneth B.

Until the transaction makes it to the \\nblockchain, it is not complete. \\nPrivate keys are the foundati on of security for cryptocurrency transactions. Private \\nkeys are generated by pseudorandom number generators (PRNGs) to generate \\nthese random positive integers. Private keys for Bitcoin and Ethereum are 78 digits \\nlong with the set of numbers from which a k ey is selected so massive in size, roughly \\nthe same size as the number of visible atoms in the universe, the probabilities of \\ngenerating two of the same private keys is negligible. As of today, there have been \\nno known hacks that have allowed someone to si gn transactions without knowing the \\nprivate key. \\nThe Process of Mining and Proof of Work\\nThe bitcoin blockchain is validated via the proof -of-work protocol, a consensus \\nmechanism used to confirm that netwo rk participants (called miners) calculate valid \\nalphanumeric codes (called hashes), verify Bitcoin transactions and include them in \\nthe next block added to the blo ckchain. \\nMiners Represent the Security Mechanism for Bitcoin\\nMining was introduced as the solution to the double -spend problem. If I have 1 \\nBitcoin and I send it to someone , and then try sending that same Bitcoin to another \\nperson , the network ensures that only one transaction will be accepted. It does this \\nthrough mining. Oneof the key features of Bitcoin is itsdecentralization , operating a \\ndigital ledger securely without the involvement of a bank, government or other \\ncentral authority. But the distributed network needs a mechanism to act as the final \\narbiter, to ensure that nobody manipulates the blockchain for their own purpos e(such \\nas to double spend existing bitcoin as above ). Mining is this decentralized security \\nsystem. \\nThe Digital Ledger Allows for the Ownership of a Digital Asset\\nTo operate a decentralized digital ledger that can be trusted is a challenge, and the \\nblock chain is the best decentralized mechanism yet created and widely accepted to \\nown a digital asset.  Because digital assets can be copied exactly, the \\ndatabase/accounting ledger recorded on the blockchain for all to see and verify \\nallows one to show the tran saction history of the digital asset and ultimately to prove \\nownership. Ownership of a digital asset, an asset that can be exactly reproduced in \\ncode, is a true innovation of the blockchain and proof of work as a validation of this \\nblockchain is again an i ncredible innovation. \\nProof -of-Work –The Protocol that Validates the Blockchain\\nBitcoin uses the proof -of-work protocol to validate the blockchain, the process by \\nwhich the digital ledger is updated by adding new blocks with all the most recent \\ntransacti ons. This proof-of-work protocol is often described as solving a \\n“cryptographic puzzle. ”The underlying tech nology that powers this immutability \\nand security is cryptographic hashing. A cryptographic hash function is a \\nmathematical function that, simply pu t, takes any input and quickly maps it to a \\nfixed -size string output.  Crypt ographic hashin g is deterministic (any input will \\nalways generate the same output), fast, unique (each input with result in a random \\nand unique output such that no two inputs will ever result in the same output), and \\nirreversible (given the output of the hash function, one cannot determine the input ).\\nThe algorithm Bitcoin uses to generate the hash is called SHA -256, whichalways \\ngenerates hashes asa 256bit number, the equivalent of 64 characters.  SHA -256 is an 9North A merica Equity Research\\n10 January 2022Kenneth B.

Bitcoin\\'s proof -of-\\nwork algorithm then generates a hash for the block.  Think of a hash like a \\nfingerprint that identifi es a speci fic piece of data.\\nMining Explained\\nMining is the process duri ng which all transactions are broadcast to the network and \\nareusually confirmed within 10 -20 minutes.  Mining is a distributed consensus \\nsystem that is used to confirm pending transactions by including them in the \\nblockchain. It enforces a chronological order in the block chain, protects the \\nneutrality  of the network, and allows different computers to agree on the state of the \\nsystem. To be confirmed, transactions must be packed i n ablock thatfit very strict \\ncryptographic rules that will b e verified by the network. These rules prevent previous \\nblocks from being modified (altering the records of past transactions for example)\\nbecause doing so would easily  and visibly invalidate all the subseque nt blocks. \\nMining also creates the equivalent of a competitive lottery that prevents certain \\nminers from repeatedly /consecutively adding new blocks to the block chain. In this \\nway, no group or individuals can control what is included in the block chain or \\nreplace parts of the block chain to their advantage .\\nMiners and Rewards\\nThe process of Bitcoin mining involves specially designed computers that aggregate \\nBitcoin transactions into a block to add to the blockchain.  In exchange, the miners 1) \\ncollect trans actio n fees and 2) are paid a reward in the form of Bitcoin by the \\nnetwork.  The process starts with Bitcoin miners selecting one megabyte worth of \\ntransactions, bundling them as an input into the SHA -256 function, and attempting to \\nfind a specific output (solving the cryptographic puzzle) the network accepts. This \\npuzzle is complex and requires significant computational resources to solve.  \\nHowever once solved, the puzzle is both easy to verify as the right solution by the \\nbroader network, while also simul taneously validating all current and past \\ntransactions in the blockchain.  Think of mining as solving a complex 10,000 picture \\npuzzle on the dinner table –it is challenging to put together but once completed it is \\neasy to verify  that all the pieces have b een put together properly.  The first miner to \\nsolve the cryptographic puzzle and find this output will publish the block to the \\nnetwork and w illreceive a reward in the form of transaction fees and the creation of \\n6.25 new Bitcoin, currently valued at ~$3 25,000.  A new Bitcoin block is added \\nevery 10 minutes, which makes the business of mining a big business. We note that \\nroughly ever y four y ears, the software running on the blockchain makes it half as \\nprofitable to mine bitcoin as it r educesthe size of the block rewards.\\nThe Cryptographic Puzzle –Hash This Hash That\\nA bitcoin block contains a header and a record of all of the new transactions, \\nincluding buyer, seller, time and date of the transactions. Each block has a unique \\nheader that is comprised of s ix pieces of information: 1) client software version, 2) \\ntimestamp of the block, 3) root o f the containing transactions’ M erkle tree, 4) hash of \\nthe prio r block, 5) a nonce and 6) the target. \\nFirst –let’s start with how a Merkle tree cha rt works.  10North A merica Equity Research\\n10 January 2022Kenneth B.

Morgan .\\nThe M erkle root (at the top of Figure 5) acts as the effective summary of all of the \\ntransactions in the block.  A Merkletree is simple concept where transaction leaves\\nare hashed together using SHA -256 into parents, and parents are hashed together \\nwith those outputs again hashed until a single Merkle root,which becomes the \\nunchangeable summary of all of the transactions in the block. If one of the \\ntransactions in the b lock were changed at a later date, the output in the Merkleroot \\nwould change all the way up the tree and would be easily recognized by any \\ncomputer node looking at the root (the top hash in the graphic below.)\\nFigure 6: When a Le af in the Merkle Tree Changes, the Parent and Root Is Altered\\nSource: J.P. Morgan .\\nFinding the Correct Nonce that Leads to the Correct Block Hash\\nThe core of mining comes from the nonce and the target, which are the basis for the \\ncryptographic puzzle th at minors have to solve to create the new block. The miner is \\ntrying to find the number (the nonce) that when added to a combination of the known \\ninformation in the header including the hash of the previous block, the transaction \\nhash of the existing block , and the timestamp of the existing block can be hashed \\ntogether using SHA -256 to generate the correct 67 digit output (the correct hash \\nsignature) for the block to be included on the blockchain.  \\nhash (ABCD)Top Hash / Merkle Root\\nhash (C)Hash Parent\\nhash (D)Hash Parent\\nhash (CD)Hash Parent\\nCTransaction Leaves\\nDTransaction Leaves\\nhash (A)Hash Parent\\nhash (B)Hash Parent\\nhash (AB)Hash Parent\\nATransaction Leaves\\nBTransaction Leaves Data \\nBlocks\\nhash (ABCD)Top Hash / Merkle Root\\nhash (C)Hash Parent\\nhash (D)Hash Parent\\nhash (CD)Hash Parent\\nCTransaction Leaves\\nDTransaction Leaves\\nhash (A)Hash Parent\\nhash (B)Hash Parent\\nhash (AB)Hash Parent\\nATransaction Leaves\\nBTransaction Leaves Data \\nBlocks11North A merica Equity Research\\n10 January 2022Kenneth B.

Both the target and the output hash are incredibly large \\nnumbers. When converted to base -10, they  are 67 digits long.  So miners will hash \\nthe block header together with their guess at the nonce over and over un til they find a \\nnonce that works. For the first block, the genesis block in Bitcoin and the easiest of \\nthe cry ptographic puzzles, it took nearly 2.1bn computations to find a nonce that \\nresulted in a hash that was acceptable. It has gotten much harder since then. \\nBelow in Figure 8, we show how the block header from one block becomes a \\ncomponent of the block header for the next block .  Go back to the Merkle tree ― if \\nany old block is altered ,the entire chain is changed ,which can be easily recognized \\nby the community, which can revert back to the prior chain. \\nFigure 8: Visual Representation of the Bitcoin Blockchain and the Role of the Block Header \\nSource: J.P. Morgan.\\nOnce a miner finds a correct nonce, the calculated hash (signature) is added to the \\nblock’s header. The signature acts as a block lock, preventing further changes to the \\ntransactions stored inside the block. The ‘winning’ miner broadcasts the complete \\nblock to other nodes that verify that the nonce results in a correct hash signature. \\nOnce 50% of the nodes verify the block, a state of consensus is reached and the block \\nis considered valid and the entire network adds the block to the chain. \\nThe miner who co rrectly  publishes the block is rewarded with new bitcoin, currently \\n6.25 bitcoin. This takes place in the mining process, as miners areallowed to add an \\nadditional output transaction to the block that attributes 6.25bitcoin to themselves. \\nEvery four years , the reward for mining bitcoin will fall in half.  Sometime in early \\n2024, the reward will fall from 6.25bitcoin to 3.125 bitcoin.  Once all the bitcoin are \\nmined sometime in 2140, miners will work solely for the mining fee. \\nThe Bitcoin network protocol adjusts the algorithm’s difficulty every two weeks to \\nmaintain a 10 minute average block time. As computational power increases (i.e., \\nthe network mining capacity increases), the time to create a block falls, and the target \\n12North A merica Equity Research\\n10 January 2022Kenneth B. W orthington, CFA\\n(1-212) 622 -6613\\nkenneth.b.worthington@jpmorgan.com\\n     \\n          \\nis made more difficult. On the contrary, if computational power declines (i.e., the \\nnetwork mining capacity declines), as what happened when China banned bitcoin \\nmining last year, the target is made easier .\\nThe Value of Bitcoin \\nNothing inherently valuable underpins the bitcoin network , similar to many  of the \\nworld’s fiatcurrencies since leaving thegold standard .  However, we do see value \\ndriven by  the Bitcoin technology that enables both the concept of digital scarcity and \\nultimately its merit as a store of value. Such digital scarcity has become more \\nvaluable since the o utbreak of Covid -19 that contributed to a significant increase in \\nglobal government debt and drove some to look for alternatives to fiat currencies as \\nglobal stores of value. \\nIn our opinion, Bitcoin is particul arly well designed as a modern store of value, and \\nthe strong design has contributed to the increased confidence in and value of Bitcoin. \\nWhile many are buying cryptocurrencies (chasing in our opinion) because the \\ncryptocurrencies are appreciating and/or a re meaningfully outperforming other asset \\nclasses, we think the merits of Bitcoin will endure near -term fluctuations in value, \\nboth in terms of digital scarcity as well as a good store of value.\\nDefining a Store of Value –Eight Characteristics \\nOur resear ch indicates that there are eight characteristics that define a good store of \\nvalue.  We see Bitcoin as being distinguished in six, but disadvantaged in two.  \\nRelative to gold, we see Bitcoin is at least or more durable, portable, fungible, \\nvisible, scarce , verifiable, and free from censorship. However, Bitcoin falls short of \\ngold in its history as a store of value and we add a ninth as a greater level of price \\nvolatility . \\n\\uf0b7Durable –Bitcoin cannot be destroyed nor does it perish.  It will survive as long \\nas the network survives, which given the network is decentralized makes bitcoin \\nvery hard to destroy. Wheat, soybeans, corn and other food items have failed in \\nhistory  as stores of value because they are perishable. When comparing gold to \\nbitcoin, both are durable.\\n\\uf0b7Portable –Bitcoin is particularly easy to store and transport. Large quantities of \\nBitcoin can be transmitted all over the world nearly instantly and can be stored \\non a cell phone.  Gold is far harder and more expensive to store, transport and \\ninsure.\\n\\uf0b7Fungible –Bitcoin is fungible and is interchangeable with all other Bitcoin. Gold \\nis generally fungible and can be readily seen as better than diamonds ,which can \\nhave different qualities and s hapes that impact value. That said, gold comes in \\ndiffer ent measures of purity with 24k gold and 14k gold of different values. The \\nedge goes to Bitcoin. \\n\\uf0b7Divisible –Bitcoin is divisible out to eight decimal places, out to 1/100,000,000, \\nwhich today is worth $0.0005. Gold is divisible, but not easily accurately . \\n\\uf0b7Scarce –Bitcoin has a finite number of tokens, capped at 21mn, which will be \\nmined by ~2140.  Gold is difficult to mine and there is expected to be a finite \\namount.  However, as the price of gold rises, so does the supply. 13North A merica Equity Research\\n10 January 2022Kenneth B. W orthington, CFA\\n(1-212) 622 -6613\\nkenneth.b.worthington@jpmorgan.com\\n     \\n          \\n\\uf0b7Verifiable –Bitcoin is read ily verifiable with transactions recorded on the \\nblockchain ,which is publicly available for all to view. Gold too is verifiable, but \\ncan also be forged and its purity can be diluted ,making value more questionable.  \\n\\uf0b7Free from censorship –A censorship re sistant asset cannot be stopped or \\nconfiscated by any authority, including governments. Users are uninhibited from \\nowning or transferring value at their discretion. No entity (including developers \\nor miners) has any undue influence on a users’ Bitcoin.  As such, Bitcoin is \\ncensorship resistant and because the protocol is decentralized, it is not subject to \\nthe demand or constraints of large corpor ations or governments. Government s \\ndo and have restricted both the ownership of gold and the transfer of gold \\nthroughout history. The Gold Reserve Act of 1934 prohibited the American \\npeople from owning gold, with the exception of jewelry and certain collector’s \\ncoins. \\nWe think Bitcoin falls short of other ‘stores -of-value’ in two ways.  First, Bitcoin has \\na limited histo ry as a store of value ,having only been created in 2009.  Gold has \\nbeen used as a store of value for a t least 5,000 years and more likely at least 7,000 \\nyears as that is w hen the first know gold mine was active. Bitcoin is also volatile, \\nwith price volatility levels materially higher than other asset classes including gold, \\nthe US$, equities and commodities. Because of the evaluated price volatility versus \\nother asset classes, Bitcoin would likely not make a good currency as hi gher \\nvolatility  could u ndermine crypto as a medium of exchange, as a unit of account and \\nas a standard for deferred payments, the other recognized functions of money.  But \\neven concerns over higher volatility have been met with Bitcoin support because \\nBitcoin has been an appreci ating asset, volatile for sure, but with significant value \\nappreciation. \\nFigure 9: Bitcoin Much More Volatile than Traditional Asset Classes \\nSource: J.P.

Morgan estimates.\\nThe Transition to Ethereum\\nWhile the technology backing bitcoin is significant, we see the use cases for Bitcoin \\nas rather one-dimensional.  Bitcoin represents digital scarcity and therefore digital \\nvalue.  But cryptocurrencies made a leap beyond digital value with the development \\nof Ethereum.  If Bitcoin is digital value, Ethereum is a digital canvas or software \\nplatform that allows developers to create new crypto and traditional applications. Its \\nuse cas es are far more significant than what we see for Bitcoin.\\nEthereum and Smart Contracts –Stage 2 \\n–dApps T ake Form\\nEthereum was launched in 2014 and it has become a further evolution in \\nthedesign of and thinking about cryptocurrency networks. It is a more funct ional and \\ngeneral computation protocol that draws upon concepts from Bitcoin to \\ncreate application -based blockchain transactions, meaning it provides more functions \\nthan just account -based sending and receiving. It utilizes blockchain technology  not \\nonly for maintaining a decentralized pay ment network but also for storing computer \\ncode that can be used to power tamper -proof decentralized financial contracts and \\napplicati ons.  So while Bitcoin is characterized as a virtual decentralized currency  \\nbest recognized as a store of value, Ethereum is a decentralized software platform \\noff of which developers leverage smart contracts to develop decentralized \\napplications and fungible/non -fungible tokens. \\nHistory of Ethereum –Building on the Base Created by \\nBitcoin\\nEthereum was created by Vitalik Buterin in 2014. (Here is a link to his w hite \\npaper Ethereum white paper published in 2013.)  Ethereum is the blockchain and \\nEther (Eth) is the token, although most refer to Ether as Eth. Vitalik became \\ninterested in Bitcoin in 2011, co -founded Bitcoin Magazine in September of that year \\nand remained immersed in all topics Bitcoin for two years. He wrote his Ethereum \\nwhite paper in Nov 2013 to build Ethereum as a blockchain based platform that could \\nbe programm ed for many more applications than what Bitcoin could do as a peer -to-\\npeer currency.

Morgan. (1/3/21)\\nThe Workings of Ethereum\\nWhile Bitcoin is positioned as a digital currency based on scarcity value, Ethereum is \\nprogrammable blockchain that is the base of many other fungible and non -fungible \\ntokens. It is often referred to as the ‘chai n-of-chains’ because it is the base -chain or \\nbuilding block for other tokens. Like other cryptocurrencies, Ethereum works on a \\nblockchain network and is therefore a decentralized, distributed public ledger on \\nwhich transactions are recorded and verified. L ike Bitcoin, Ethereum utilizes the \\nproof -of-work protocol to validate its blockchain. But there are some key differences \\nbetween Bitcoin and Ethereum. Ether block time is faster (Ether transactions are \\nconfirmed in seconds while Bitcoin transactions take m inutes). Ether uses a different \\nprocessing algorithm with Bitcoin transactions run off the SHA -256 and Ethereum \\nEtash. While Ethereum currently runs on proof -of-work, it will convert to proof -of-\\nstake mid -2022, a change that we expect could alter the crypt ocurrency  landscape, as \\nwe discuss further below.\\nA most significant difference between Bitcoin and Ethereum is that Ethereum is \\nprogrammable and the Ethereum network can perform computations. It is this \\ncomputatio nal capability that turns what is a store of value and medium of exchange \\nfor Bitcoin into a global computing engine and openly verifiable data store in \\nEthereum. Ethereum as a programmable network allows for self -executing contracts \\n(smart contracts) with agreements programmed right into the Ethe reum blockchain.\\nEthereum operates under and benefits from three characteristics:\\n\\uf0b7Large Decentralized Network –Ethereum is the largest cryptocurrency \\necosystem and has a significant community committed to the protocol. As such \\nthere are significant number s of smart contracts that have already been written \\nand vetted by blockchain engineers in Solidity (Ethereum’s programming \\nlanguage) that can be integrated or expanded into new blockchain solutions. In \\naddition, Ethereum h as been tested with billions of do llars of transactio nsand \\nthus operates with significant credibility .This draws even more programmers \\nand users to the Ethereum network.   $bn$100bn$200bn$300bn$400bn$500bn$600bn$700bn$800bn$900bnMarket Cap of Top 20 Coins16North A merica Equity Research\\n10 January 2022Kenneth B.

Ethereum’s decentralized \\nnetwork promises to let users leave behind third -party intermediaries, like \\nlawy ers who write and interpret contracts, banks that are intermediaries in \\nfinancial transactions or third -party web hosting services.\\n\\uf0b7Upgrades of the Functionality ‒A large community of Ethereum developers is \\nlooking for ways to improve the network and develop new applications. \\nEthereum is an evolving blockchain. Recent upgrade s(discussed in a separate \\npiece of research on the London Hard Fork )introd uced the ability to burn tokens \\nand limit Ethereum mining driv en inflation, for example .  However, the most \\nradical change is expected mid-2022 when Ethereum is expected to migrate from \\nProof -of-Work to Proof -of-Stake . \\nEthereum –the Chain of Chains Drives New Applications \\nBecause Ethereum is programmable, there ar e significant applications that have been \\ndeveloped using the Ethereum technology.  This begins with sm art contracts through \\nto dApps and fungible/non -fungible tokens.  We see five general uses for Ethereum.\\n\\uf0b7Currency: Similar to Bitcoin, you can send and receive Eth or pay for goods \\nand services. As such, Eth (Ether) can be a store of value. \\n\\uf0b7Smart contracts: Ethereum allows for the development of smart contracts, \\npermissionless applications that automatically execute when the contract’s \\nconditio ns have been met.  It is these smart -contracts that are the basis for the \\nother applications described below.  \\n\\uf0b7Digital apps, or dApps :Ethereum powers digital apps that allow users to play \\ngames, invest, send money, track an i nvestment portfolio, follow social media \\nand more. Currently, over 440,000 ERC -20 tokens have been developed on \\nEthereum. \\n\\uf0b7Non-fungible tokens :The majority of NFTs are p owered by Ethereum and can \\nallow artists or others to sell art or other items directly to buyers using smart \\ncontracts. NFTs are ERC -721, non -fungible tokens. The bonus here is that one \\ncan build a royalty structure right into the blockchain, empowering th e content \\ncreator.\\n\\uf0b7Decentralized finance: By using Ethereum, some people may be able to avoid \\ncentralized (government, bank) control ove r the movement of money or other \\nassets. DeFi is trying to put the central functions of financial services companies \\non the blockchain, essentially cutting out the bank/broker/exchange as the \\nfinancial intermediary with the promise of greater speed, lower cost and greater \\nsecurity . \\nSmart Contracts on Ethereum \\nSmart contracts are the base on which dApps , NFTs and DeFi are created. A smart \\ncontract refers to a piece of computer program that gets executed by a quorum of \\nblockchain nodes and often facilitate the exchange of money, share or property. At \\ntheir core, smart contracts are executable programs used to automate the ex ecution of \\nan agreement on the blockchain without the need for intermediaries. 17North A merica Equity Research\\n10 January 2022Kenneth B.

They contain terms \\nand condi tions of a mutually agreed contract and can define rules like a regular \\ncontrac t, but that is automatically enforced via the code. Smart contracts are not \\nlegally  binding the way traditional contracts are. Yet, smart contracts are powerful \\nbecause they can increase the speed, accuracy, and integrity in payment and \\nperformance transac tions.  Once executed, the smart contract cannot be altered. Yet \\nthe ability for Ethereum to support the development of smart contracts is key in the \\nfurther development of Decentralized Applications including fungible and non -\\nfungible tokens and ultimatel y decentralized finance , discussed further below. \\nIn Figure 12 below, we show that smart contracts are based on program functions, \\nwith inputs processed to create outputs. The logic inside smart contracts determine if \\na transaction is valid, with valid tr ansactions result ingin updated blockchain state, \\nwith invalid transactions rejected by the network from being included.

As such, dApps are open -sourc e and operate without one \\nentity  controlling its data , with records that are publicly available and use a \\ncryptographic token to keep the network secure.  dApps are built by combining a \\nuser interface front -end and smart contract back -end.  \\ndApp =Front-end+Smart Contract Back-end\\nIn dApps , the fro nt-end can be programmed in any language, but w ill call aback-end \\nwritten into the blockchain.

Instead of employing \\nthe HTTP protocol to communicate with the b roader network, dApps connect to the \\nblockchain in a decentralized manner rather than routing through cen tralized servers. \\nWe see the power of dApps is their decentralization, which makes them both free \\nfrom cens orship and easier to create. dApps are characterized by:\\n\\uf0b7Open source : The code is public for anyone to look at, copy and audit.\\n\\uf0b7Decentralization : dApps don’t have anyone in charge, so no central authority \\ncan stop users from doing what they want on the app.\\n\\uf0b7No Downtime: After deploying thesmart contract ontheblockchain, the\\nnetwork canalways serve theneeds ofclients whowant tointeract with the\\nsmart contract. Furthermore, dApps canalsoensure thatanymalicious actors\\ncannot launch denial -of-service attacks onspecific apps. Itwillcontinue to\\nfunction even ifparts ofthenetwork architecture arenon-functional.\\n\\uf0b7Censorship Free: Decentralized apps donotallow control ofthedata and\\nprocesses toasingle entity.Therefore, itisimpossible foranygovernment or\\nentity toblock users from submitting transactions ordeploying dApps, andeven\\nreading data from theblockchain. Without anyspecifi cindividual or\\norganizatio ncontrolling adApp ,users have theadvantage ofcomplete freedom\\nwith dApps.\\n\\uf0b7Private : You would find that a major share of decentralized applications does \\nnot demand the real identity of users. Rather than going through a complicated \\nand lengthy signup process, users could access dApps with their Ethereum login \\ncredentials and a digital wallet.\\n\\uf0b7Data Integrity: With the power of cryptography , decentralized applications \\nensure the secure storage of data on relevant blockchai n networks. Furthermore, \\nthe accessibility of public blockchain for verify ing transactions also provides the \\nassurance of reliability in data records.19North A merica Equity Research\\n10 January 2022Kenneth B.

Ethereum makes dApp \\ndevelopment easier by offering a development interface that reduces programming \\ntime and helps projects quickly launch. In addition, the Ethereum developer \\ncommunity has grown significant ly since the platform’s launch with a network that \\nshares code and ideas. Ethereum also retains formidable network effects from its \\nglobal coalition of technologists who remain committed to maintaining the network \\nand actively developing user resources tha t drive adoption. The ability to monetize \\nDApp projects incentivizes others to par take in the Ethereum ecosystem.\\nEthereum also uses a network -native language Solidity for coding smart contracts. \\nBut the network architecture eliminates the need to develop an entirely new \\nblockchain for ever y dApp. Once a smart contract is created, it is uploaded to the \\nEthereum Virtual Machine (EVM) ,which is a runtime compiler that executes the \\nsmart contract code. EVM is operated in what is called a ‘sandbox’ environment ,\\nwhich is isolated from the main n etwork to create an optimal testing environment. \\nOnce the code is on the EVM, everyone part of the Ethereum network has a copy of \\nthe contract. Once the smart contract is tested and verified ,it is uploaded to the \\nEthereum Mainnet.  \\nDevelopers can work with the ready -made Ethereum system to fast -track o nboarding \\nand get their applications up and running sooner than other alternatives. By \\ncombining application templates and the EVM, the overall Ethereum development \\nkit allo ws companies to focus on refining their applications and developing on top of \\nopen -source code among a global, mission -based developer community.\\ndApps and Tokenization\\nWe see tokenization as one of the major foundations of Ethereum. Tokenization is a \\nfeature used to define smart contracts and is acore element in dApps. But when we \\nrefer to tokens, there are two standards that have emerged on Ethereum ‒ERC -20 \\nand ERC -721. (The ERC stands for Ether eum Request for Comment, which i s the \\nsystem that allows for comments onthe standardization of Ethereum tokens and \\nfeatures a standard set of rules for creating tokens. ) As we reflect back, we see a \\nnumber of references to 2021 as the year of the NFT. To us, it is just the beginning of \\ntokenization. \\nERC -20 vs. E RC-721 Tokens\\nThere are two main token standards for Ethereum tokens.  At their most basic level, \\nERC -20 tokens are fungible tokens and are used for all smart contracts on the \\nEthereum blockchain.  Examples include BinanceCoin (BNB) ,the fourth largest \\ntoken by  market cap at $78bn, Stablecoins Tether and USDC ,which have a \\ncombined market cap of $ 121bn.  ERC -721 are non -fungible tokens (NFTs) ,which\\narea type of unique digital certificate, registered on a blockchain that can be used to \\nrecord ownership of any asset, best known for digital collectibles. While ERC -20 \\ntokens represent a single asset and are interchangeable, ERC -721 tokens are \\nindivisible and represent a collection of assets. Examples here including \\nCryptoKitti es, Etheremons, Crypto Bots, and B lockchain Cuties.20North A merica Equity Research\\n10 January 2022Kenneth B.

Morgan.\\nERC -20 –The Fungible Tokens\\nERC -20 was created by Fabian Vogelsteller in 2015 and is the standard for creating \\nfungible tokens that are comp atible with the broader Ethereum network. ERC -20 \\ntokens are built on the Ether eum blockchain and adhere to a set of standards that \\nallow the tokens to work with all other Ethereum smart contracts, enabling the \\nexchange of one ERC -20 token for another and allowing the easy i ntegration with \\nother smart c ontracts, wallets, or marketplace s. ERC -20 smart contracts use ERC -20 \\ntokens to make payments when their protocol calls for it. Any smart contract that \\ninvolves pa yments will therefore pay the user in the for m of an ERC -20 token. \\nMany  dApps built o n Ethereum have their own cryptocurrencies or “tokens.” As of \\nAugust, there were over 440,000 ERC -20 tokens on Ethereum’s main network across \\nmore than 900 projects.  ERC -20 tokens are typically sold via a variety o f different \\nofferings as a way to raise early -stage capital for the underlying project. Many of the \\nprojects raised money in the initial coin offering boom of 2017.\\n21North A merica Equity Research\\n10 January 2022Kenneth B.

Morgan.\\nIn order to interact with the dApps, users need to purchase the dApp’s native token. \\nOne purchases an Ethereum -based NFT using the ETH token, for example. Generally \\nspeaking, a token represents something specific in a given ecosystem. This could be \\neconomic value, a dividend, a stake, a voting right , really anything. It’s important to \\nunderstand that a token is not limited to one particular role; it can fulfill various \\ndifferent of roles in its native ecosystem.  That said, the most common u se for tokens \\nis to transact. T here are three types of blockchain -based tokens that we will discuss:\\n\\uf0b7Usage tokens: A token that is required to use a service. These are the tokens that \\nfunction like a currency in their respective dApps. This is generally th e most \\nsimple and straightforward application of a token. These tokens have monetary \\nvalue , but don’t come with any sort of rights or privilege within the particular \\nnetwork.\\n\\uf0b7Work tokens: A token that gives users the right to contribute work to a DAO \\nand e arn in exchange for their work. In this model, the user (or service provider) \\nstakes the native token of the network to earn the right to perform work for the \\nnetwork. Given a fixed supply of tokens, service providers will rationally pay \\nmore per token for the right to earn part of a growing cash flow stream. The \\nimportant thing to understand at this stage is that work tokens grant access to the \\nnetwork and provide cash flow potential conditional on the deliver y of work \\nwith the token .\\n\\uf0b7Security tokens: An external, tradable asset that is a representation of value in a \\nsystem. Security  tokens, also known as tokenized securities or investment \\ntokens, are financial securities compliant with SEC regulations. What makes \\nsecurity tokens so neat (and potentially re volutionary) is that the rights are \\nwritten into a smart contract and the tokens are traded o n a blockchain -powered \\nexchange –24/7/365 with near instant settlement.\\n22North A merica Equity Research\\n10 January 2022Kenneth B.

In return, investors receive newly minted tokens \\nprior to the official launch at wholesale prices.\\n\\uf0b7Voting rights: Tokens can be used for voting on project decisions. In this \\ninstance, the more tokens users have ,the more influence they have over each \\nelection.\\n\\uf0b7Represent physical objects: Atoken can represent ownership of assets, such as \\ngold.\\n\\uf0b7New features: Sometimes builders need a token for paying for the functionality \\nof their projects, but the native token on Ethereum, Eth, is not enough for them. \\nSo, they  create a new token with the fu nctionality they need.\\nERC -721 T okens --NFTs\\nThe ERC -721 Token standard enables Non -Fungible Tokens (NFTs) on the Ethereum \\nblockchain. J ust like the ERC -20 token standard helps in creating fungible tokens, the \\nERC -721 focuses on non -fungible asset s. ERC -721 tokens help bring the concept of \\nuniqueness to the blockchain, ensuring that distinctive details about an asset can be \\nimmortalized. NFTs can be used to provide digital representation of a one -of-a-kind \\nartwork, with ownership that is easily proved thro ugh blockchain records and can \\nlimit things like counterfeiting.\\nThe Ethereum Foundation describes the workings of an NFT like this.  An NFT has \\none owner at a time, which is managed through the uniqueID and metadata that no \\nother token can replicate. NFTs are minted through smart contracts that assign \\nownership and manage the transferability. When an NFT is created, the creator \\nexecutes code stored in smart contracts that conform to a certain standard, such as \\nERC -721, and th is information is added to the blockchain where the NFT is being \\nmanaged. The minting process, from a high level, has the following ste ps that it goes \\nthrough:\\n\\uf0b7Creating a new block$bn$50bn$100bn$150bn$200bn$250bn$300bn$350bn$400bn$450bn$500bn\\n4Q18 2Q19 4Q19 2Q20 4Q20 2Q21 4Q21Market Cap of ETH vs  25 Largest ERC -20 Tokens\\nEthereum Top 2523North A merica Equity Research\\n10 January 2022Kenneth B.

While we discuss the implications later in \\nthe note, some key properties are as follows.  \\n1.Each NFT has a unique identifier that is directly linked to one Ethereum \\naddress.\\n2.NTFs are not directly interchangeable with other tokens 1:1. For example 1 \\nETH is exactly the same as another ETH. This isn\\'t the case with NFTs. \\n3.Each token has an owner and this information is easily verifiable.  Here, the \\ntoken proves that the copy of t he digital file is the original and the private \\nkey is proof -of-ownership of the original.  The content creator\\'s public key \\nserves as a certificate of authenticity for that particular NFT. \\n4.They  live on Ethereum and can be bought and sold on any Ethereum -based \\nNFT market.\\nCurrent use cases for NFTs are in digital entertainment including art and music, but\\nare increasingly being used as assets in gaming. We expect NFTs will become a key \\npart of DeFi with the tokenization of particular value for ill iquid assets.  Below we \\nshow a compare and contrast between the current internet and an NFT internet, \\nwhich is presented by the Ether eum Organization. \\nTable 1: The NFT Internet vs. the Internet Today –A Compare and Contrast\\nAn NFT Internet The Internet Today\\nNFTs are digitally unique, no two NFTs are the \\nsame.A copy of a file, like an .mp3 or .jpg is the same as \\nthe original.\\nEvery NFT must have an owner and this is of public \\nrecord and easy for anyone to verify.Ownership records of digital items are stored on \\nservers controlled by institutions -you must take their \\nword for it.\\nNFTs are compatible with anything built using \\nEthereum. An NFT Ticker for an event can be traded \\non every Ethereum marketplace, for an entirely\\ndifferent NFT.

Morgan.\\nThe Downside of Ethereum –Getting More Congested and \\nExpensive \\nEthereum’s success and popularity have created a number of problems for the \\nnetwork. With increasing numbers of fungible and non -fungible tokens running on \\nEthereum, network congestion have driven gas prices /transaction fees to rise \\nmaterially for Ether eum based transactions, making it expensive to transact on the \\nnetwork. It can regularly cost $40 -$50 per transaction, making the purchase of simple \\nNFTs or th e movement of Ethereum from one wallet to another an expensive \\nproposition. Ethereum is also energy intensive and doesn\\'t communicate well with \\nother blockchains. It\\'s a bit like having a cellphone that can only textusers o n the \\nsame network. Ultimately E thereum’s problem has been its limited ability to scale \\nwith the increasing popularity of the network. \\nLack of Scalability\\nOne of the core problems with the Ethereum platform has been scalability. As more \\nand more decentralized apps use the platform, and transactions increase \\nexponentially, so do the gas fees. Simply put, if there are too many users on the \\nblockchain, it gets more expensive to buy and sell things.\\nIncrease Cost to Transact on Ethereum –Rising Transaction Costs\\nEthereum’s growing popularit y has led to higher transaction costs. Ethereum \\ntransaction fees, also known as “gas,” have been rising for much of 2021 . When we \\ntried to buy NFTs for the kids for presents this holiday season, weended up paying \\nmore in gas fees than in NFT prices.  Whil e in Bitcoin the network itself rewards \\ntransaction verifiers, Ethereum requires those participating in the transaction to cover \\nthe fee.  In Ethereum\\'s current state, only those with larger holdings can make use of \\nthe benefits of its ecosystem. Swapping cryptocurrencies on Uniswap, a \\ndecentralized exchange and liquidity provider on Ethereum\\'s network, costs nearly  \\n$150 earlier this year, making trading small amounts of money impractical .$1mn $6mn $18mn$13bn\\n$bn$2bn$4bn$6bn$8bn$10bn$12bn$14bn\\n2018 2019 2020 2021OpenSea Transaction Volume25North A merica Equity Research\\n10 January 2022Kenneth B.

Processing transactions on Ethereum network requires computational \\npower and gas is the fee paid to miners for providing that computational power. Gas \\nfees are measured in Gwei, the smallest base unit of ETH ‒1/1,000,000,000 of an \\nETH . Gas fees were created to both compensate and incentivize the miners to \\nundertake the computational costs of using the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) to \\nexecute the transaction.  But Gas fees also help keep the Ethereum network secure. \\nAttaching cost to every transaction prevents spamming or accidental infinity loops \\nthat could un intentionally or maliciously con sume the resources of Ethereum and \\nprevent new transactions from being recorded. More complex transactions require \\nmore gas to execute, with t ransactions involving smart contracts costing more than \\ntransfers of ETH between two wallets. Average daily gas prices in Dec 2021 have \\nranged from a low of $62 on Dec 19 to a high of $156 on Dec 4. Because transaction \\nfees need to be paid in Eth, particip ants on the Ethereum blockchain need to acquire \\nETH ,which results in value for ETH.\\nFigure 18: Eth Gas Prices Remains High\\nSource: ycharts.com\\nEthereum Suffers from Slower Transaction Speeds\\nEthereum runs at 15 transactions per second. This is faster than Bitcoin’s 7tps, but is \\nsubstantially slower than the Mas terCard’s network, for example that can process \\n5,000tps. Ethereum transaction speeds are being hurt by a number of factors \\nincluding greater data store needs given the inc reased usage of Ethereum and the \\nneed to drive consensus with an increasing number of nodes.

While the number of bitcoin tokens \\nis capped at 21mn , the number of Ethereum tokens had been rising at an ~4.7% \\nannual inflation rate (2020 inflation rate) ,driven by mining rewards at 2 ETH/block. \\nHowever, with the release of EIP -1559 (explained further below), ETH is now being \\nburned as part of ever y Ethereum transaction and thus the rate of inflation has fallen \\nto 1.7%.

When Ethereum \\nconverts to proof -of-stake, the sel ection process to validate the blockchain will \\nmigrate f rom solving the cryptographic puzzles to token ownership. Those that \\nown mo re Ethereum and/or own it longer will have a greater chance of adding \\nblocks to the Ethereum blockchain and earn a reward.  T he software required to \\nvalidate an Ethereum block in proof -of-stake can be done on a laptop with \\nexpected electricity costs of $150/year.  The proof -of-work protocol used to \\nvalidate the Bitcoin and Ethereum blockchains consumes significant energy as \\nmine rs seek to calculate the nonce. Currently Ethereum mining is estimated to \\nconsume ~44.5TWh/year in aggregate, on the magnitude of the energy Honduras \\nconsumed in 2016. \\n2)Ethereum scalability –Ethereum 2.0 plans to scale its capacity by using a \\nmethod calle d sharding, that is hoped/expected will greatly increase \\ntransaction speeds, potentially scaling its ability to 100,000 transactions per \\nsecond or more. Sharding is a way to partition a database into smaller pieces , \\nspreading execution into 64 new shard ch ains that are more manageable. With a \\nPoW blockchain, most nodes, or co mputers in the network, have an entire copy \\nof the history of transactions. This entire history can take up a lot of space, \\nespecially  for older cryptocurrencies with a long history of transactio ns. With \\nsharding on PoS, the blockchain is cut up into parallel sections, and nodes are \\nassigned to one section instead of having to hold the entirety of the chain\\'s data. \\nThis allows more transactions to be processed simultaneously, greatly in creasing \\nthroughput and transaction speed. Sharding is expected a fter the Ethereum \\nmerge, toward year-end 2022 or 2023. \\n3)Ethereum Deflation –We believe that Ethereum issuance could be deflationary \\nfollowing the merge. Inflation take splace when new tokens are mined (in the \\ncase of proof -of-work) or minting (in the case of proof -of-stake) as part of the \\nrewards given to those that are adding blocks and validating the blockchains. \\nHowever, we estimate that the migration from proof -of-work to proof -of-stake \\ncombined with the burn introduced in EIP -1559 could drive Ethereum to \\ndeflation and negative token issuance. We estimate that Ethereum’s inflation rate \\nwas ~4.2% annually prior to the implementation of EIP -1559. Block rewards of \\n2 Eth for mining Ethereum blocks resulted in ~13,000Eth created each day \\n@2eth x 6,500 blocks/day.  However, EIP-1559 is driving Eth to be burne d \\n(taken out of existence) as a portion of the gas fee is now burnt rather than paid \\nto the miner s.  We note that s ince the introduction of EIP -1559, Eth issuance has \\ndeclined 66% and when transaction activity is particularly elevated, Eth can be \\ndeflationary . \\nTable 2: Burned Rewards since the Introduction of EIP -1559 through Jan 3, 2022\\nETH USD Equivalent\\nBurned 1,342,310 $4,964,190,183\\nRewards 2,031,053 $7,511,321,476\\nTips 249,467 $922,587,702\\nNet Issuance 688,743 $2,547,138,435\\nSource: watchtheburn.com and J.P.

W orthington, CFA\\n(1-212) 622 -6613\\nkenneth.b.worthington@jpmorgan.com\\n     \\n          \\nWe expect that following the merge that Ethereum will enter a deflationary period.  \\nThe rewards for miners total 2 -Eth per block, ~4.8mn Eth created each year.  \\nHowever, rewards for proof -of-stake appear far lower for validators, ~0.0052Eth.  \\nThis lower re ward is justified by the far lower resources that validation required \\nunder proof -of-stake.  But it also means that with far lower block rewards under \\nproof -of-stake that the burn will likely result in deflation, which depending on \\ntransaction levels and g as-prices could burn 1 -2mn Eth/year. \\nWhat\\'s Next for CryptoCurrencies\\nWe think it important to think about outlook for the cryptomarkets based on use \\ncases and potential.  We are confident only in that we’re probably not doing justice to \\nall the potentia l applications that those tech savvy and creative entrepreneurs will \\ndevelop in the coming years.  Some/much of this potential will be based on \\nimprovements in both layer -1 and lay er-2 chains and most importantly more \\ncertainty  around regulation.  We concl ude this note by walking through a bit more in \\ndepth about Web3.0, NFTs, DeFi and the companies that we have encountered in the \\ncryptoecosystem with some help from our J.P. Morgan crypto colleagues Christine \\nMoy and Stoyan Djourov who run Onyx by JPMorgan, J.P. Morgan’s blockchain \\nbusiness.\\nFrom Web2.0 to Web3.0 –Crypto’s Contribution\\nWe are using the web differently today than we did twenty years ago, and we will \\nuse it differently twenty years in the future, wesuspect.  We start with a description \\nof Web3.0 and a brief overview of the earlier world -wide -web.\\n\\uf0b7Web1.0 –The Web was for consumers of content and wasoften referred to as \\nthe read -only web.  T he creators were typically developers who built websites \\nthat contained information served up mainly in text or image format. Web 1.0 \\nlasted approximately from 1991 to 2004. \\n\\uf0b7Web2.0 –Web2.0 is often referred to as the read/write web.  The Web beca me a \\nplatform and applications were built on the web rather than on desktops.  \\nWeb2.0 gave us more content creation on social networks, blogs, sharing sites \\nand more. One didn’t / doesn’t have to be a developer to participate in the \\ncreation process. If you want to upload a video and allow millions of people to \\nsee it, in teract with it, and comment on it, you can do that in Web2.0 .Web 2.0’s \\ninternet was a massive app store, dominated by centralized apps from Google, \\nFacebook and Amazon where monetizations took place via targeted advertising.  \\nHowever, Web2.0 is plagued wi th secur ity and data breaches since in W eb2.0, \\nyou don’t have any control over your data or how it is stored.\\n\\uf0b7Web3.0 –Web3.0 is the read/w rite/intelligence web.  It repr esents a smarter \\ninternet.  Web 3.0 enables a future where distributed users and machin es are able \\nto interact with data, value and other counterparties via a substrate of peer -to-\\npeer networks without the need for third parties. Decentralization is a key part of \\nWeb3.0, and as such applications either run on blockchains, decentralized \\nnetwo rks of many  peer to peer nodes (servers), or a combination of the two that \\nforms a cryptoeconomic protocol . These are often referred to as dApps. 32North A merica Equity Research\\n10 January 2022Kenneth B.

Our understanding is that NFTs \\ntransformed Art Basil in Miami this past December.  But the utilization of NFTs \\nseems likely at its early stages and we see financial services as holding great \\npotential for tokenization broadly.  Some use cases f or NFTs areas follows. \\n33North A merica Equity Research\\n10 January 2022Kenneth B.

Morgan\\nGaming –The development of games take a bit longer than art or music, and we \\nexpect gaming will use NFTs in a much bigger way.  Concepts like play -to-earn are \\ndeveloping with NFTs as the assets in the games. Given the interoperability of \\nEthereum based tokens, we would expect ERC -721 to be the more likely standard \\nutilized in the early development of these game s.\\nNFTs as Tickets –NFTs can be the ticket to a concert, the memento, and the key to \\nunlocking backstage access all in one, but also automatically takes the ticket \\nproceeds and divides them between the artist, the crew, the venue. While the ticket \\ncan be made exclusive to cut out the scalpers, tickets that can be resold can \\nautomatically allocate any increase in ticket price on resale to the artist, crew and \\nvenue so that the content creators benefit from the upside.  I’m sure there will be \\nmore interestin g applications over time. \\nNFTs in the Metaverse –The metaverse canbe a place to store and appreciate NFT \\nart, it’s a hub for gaming, it’s a virtual reality world.  Like gaming, NFTs are \\npositioned to be the assets in the metaverse, with Ethereum as its currency. \\nTokenization of Ever ything. –Tokenization would seem to hold great potential for \\nfinancial services, in particular for illiquid assets that could benefit from price \\ndiscover y, liquidity , asset servicing, and asset composition. Settlement times for \\nequities at T+2 and for credit settlement is T+10+ , with som e products as long as \\nT+40 would benefit from tokenization. While transaction speeds are too slow for the \\nliquid products, there is the advantage of 24/7/365 trading, in addition to the risk \\nmitigation (and capital relief) that comes with near instant settlement. In our future \\nwe see the tokenization (and fractionalization) of credit, equities, parts of real estate \\n(commercial to residential to hotel rooms), and non -traded investments including\\nprivate equity.\\nDeFi –The Value of Crypto in Decentralized Finance\\nDecentralized Finance appears as a large opportunity for cryptomarkets to both \\nparticipate in and in some cases to disintermediate traditional finance. DeFi is \\nattempting to replicate ma ny or most of the products and services offered by banks, \\nincluding borrowing, lending, buying insurance, trading derivatives, buying assets, \\n34North A merica Equity Research\\n10 January 2022Kenneth B. W orthington, CFA\\n(1-212) 622 -6613\\nkenneth.b.worthington@jpmorgan.com\\n     \\n          \\nand earning interest. The existing financial system in the US has functioned for more \\nthan a century and operates under a regulatory framework that has been in place \\nsince the 1930s and 1940s.  DeFi is offering many of the same products and services \\nas traditio nal financial services firm s, but offers them in an updated framework, with \\nthe opportunity to operate faster and more efficiently in crypto’s peer -to-peer \\nnetwork rather than through system of independent companies and entities.  While \\nDeFi inherits many of Ethereum’s problems such as speed and cost, we see these \\nproblems as solvable and thus see DeFi as present ing a possibly more efficient \\nframework to offer financial services in the future. \\nFigure 24: Traditional Finance and its Decentralized Finance Challenger\\nSource: Consensys .\\nTrad Finance Has Excesses\\nOur traditional financial system today has more intermediaries than it probably \\nneeds.  Compare a trade in traditional finance to one for cryptocurrencies. In \\ntraditional finance, parties involved in a trade include the mobile app, the broker, the \\nmarket m aker, the exchange, the prime broker, the clearing house, custodian and \\ntransfer agent for the buyer and those same financial participants for the seller.  In the \\ncryptoecosystem when transacting with a token, there is the buyer, the intermediary \\nand the s eller.  In the cryptoecosystem, out of necessity and/or by design, the \\nintermediaries are vertically integrated. \\nExamples of DeFi today\\nThere are a number of examples where DeFi is permeating financial services. \\n\\uf0b7Lending : Lend out your crypto and ea rn int erest and rewards ever y minute –not \\nonce per month. Lending is based on the c ollateralization of crypto assets by \\nlocking them in smart contracts and borrowing against that collateral . Interest \\npayments, maturity  and lifecycle processes are all automated through the \\nprotocol .  It is estimated that $52bn is the value currently locked in lending \\nprotocols such as AAVE and Compound. \\n\\uf0b7Getting a loan: Obtain a loan instantly without filling in paperwork, including \\nextremely  short -term “flash loans” that traditional financial institutions don’t \\noffer.\\n35North A merica Equity Research\\n10 January 2022Kenneth B. W orthington, CFA\\n(1-212) 622 -6613\\nkenneth.b.worthington@jpmorgan.com\\n     \\n          \\n\\uf0b7Making a Payment: Decentralized payment tools designed to facilitate invoicing \\nand pay ments between merchants and customers. Here, d igital -native assets \\nstand out from legacy digital payment methods, such as those run by Visa and \\nPayPal, in that they remove all middlemen from transactions. When you pay \\nwith a credit card for coffee at a cafe, a financial institution sits between you and \\nthe business, with control over the transaction, retaining the authority t o stop or \\npause it and record it in its private ledger. By paying in cryptocurrencies, those \\ninstitutions could be cut out of the picture.  There is ~$3bn of value locked in \\ndecentralized payments in protocols such as Salier. \\nStablecoins : Another form of DeFi is the stablecoin. Cryptocurrencies often \\nexperience sharper price fluctuations than fiat. Stablecoi ns peg cryptocurrencies to \\nnon-cryptocurrencies, such as the US dollar, in order to keep the price under control. \\nWith the ability to send crypto like money, cyptocurrencies could alter the remittance \\nmarkets , B2B payments and cross -border money transfers.  While some see the \\ninterchange -fees charged by credit card companies as being at risk, this is not \\nconsidered the base case for the J.P. Morgan payme nts team. An example of DeFi in \\nstablecoins is Maker, a platform that collateralizes assets to create a stablecoin. \\nTrading : Non -custodial automated market making protocols running a decentralized \\norderbook.  Here, order matching and price -setting can be done completely \\nalgorithmically, allowing peer -to-peer trades of certain crypto assets without any \\nkind of brokerage.  There is ~$31bn locked in Decentralized Exchanges such as \\nUniswap. \\nSaving for the future : Put some of your crypto into savings account a lternatives and \\nearn better interest rates than you’d typically get from a bank.\\nBuying derivatives : Tokenized derivatives created without the need for a third party.  \\nCounterparty agreements are programmatically encoded, reducing the risk for \\nmalicious a ctivity.   Make long or short bets on certain assets. Think of these as the \\ncrypto version of stock options or futures contracts. There is an estimated $4.1bn \\nlocked in DeFi derivative protocols such as Synthetix. 36North A merica Equity Research\\n10 January 2022Kenneth B.

DeFi is distinct because it \\nexpands the use of blockchain from simple value transfer to more complex \\nfinancial use cases. Cutting out middlemen from all kinds of transactions is one \\nof the primary  advantages of decentralized finance.\\n\\uf0b7Open: You don’t need to apply for anything or “open” an account. You just get \\naccess by creating a wallet.\\n\\uf0b7Pseudonon ymous: You don’t need to provide your name, email address, or any \\npersonal information.\\n\\uf0b7Flexible: You can move your assets anywhere at any time, without asking for \\npermission, waiting for long transfers to finish, and paying expensive fees\\n\\uf0b7Fast: Interest Rates and rewards often update rapidly (as quickly as every 15 \\nseconds), and can be signific antly  higher than traditional Wall Street.\\n\\uf0b7Transparent: Everyone involved can see the full set of transactions (private \\ncorporations rarely grant that kind of transparency) .\\n37North A merica Equity Research\\n10 January 2022Kenneth B.

As mentioned above, the \\ndownside is network congestion and the impact that has on increasing gas costs and \\ntransaction expenses.  As such, DeFi that results in active transactions ca n be very \\nexpensive.  Other issues such as token volatility, the need to monitor transactions for \\ntax purposes and varying regulation from one region to another are also highlighted \\nas risks to DeFi. \\nTraditional Financial Services Companies Start to Embra ce Cryptocurrency \\nTechnology.\\n\\uf0b7Traditional Financial Services firms are servicing clients that want to engage in \\nthe cry ptoecosystem.  There are also examples where financial firms are \\nembracing the cryptoecosystem to make traditional financial offerings be tter.  \\nHere, we see traditional financial services on the front -end, but DeFi powering \\nthe back -end.  However, we see the current regulatory environment (really the \\nlack of Federal Crypto Rules and Regulation) limiting the presence that \\ntraditional finance can have in crypto.  There is just too much to lose if new rules \\nare put into place that run contrary to the ways that traditional financial service \\nfirms might be engaging with crypto.

The Ether eum merge is expected mid-2022 ,which \\nwill drive much greater energy efficiently, and we expect will position the \\n‘chain -of-chains’ fora significant boost to capacity, transaction speed and \\nusability as we enter 2023.  If 2021 was the year of the NFT, we see 2022 \\nas possibly the year of the blockchain bridge (driving greater \\ninteroperability of various chains) or the year of financial tokenization. As \\nsuch, we see the cryptocurrency markets as increasingly relevant to \\nfinancial services. \\n\\uf0b7Bitcoin –Stage -1.Bitcoin leverages blockchain technology to create \\ndecentralized ownership of digital assets, leveraging the transparency of \\na digital l edger. (We continue to see this innovation as amazing.) Bitcoin \\nas a digital currency has value in that it is highly efficient to own and \\ntransact –anywhere in the world in 30 minutes or less. But its nature as a \\ndigital asset contains a number of attribu tes that makes Bitcoin valuable \\nas digital scarcity and as a better store of value often referred to a digital \\ngold. \\n\\uf0b7Ethereum –Stage -2.Ether eum is the evolution of cryptocurrencies to a \\nprogrammable blockchain, a network that performs computations. This \\nmakes Ether eum smart and turns the blockchain into a global computing \\nengine, secured and transparent. This is wher e the fun really begins \\nbecause this programmability allows the development of smart contracts, \\nwhich drives the creation of decentralized app s dApps and more . \\n\\uf0b7The Implications .The applications from crypto have only just begun. \\nWeb3.0, greater use of NFTs and tokenization are in the line-of-sight for \\n2022. As financial analyst s, we are most excited about the implications \\nfor financial services and see the tokenization and fractionalization as \\nholding particularly large prom ise as transactions speeds in crypto \\nbecome more competitive with trad-fi networks. DeFi was a bit of a flop \\nin 2021, but still has strong potential in 2022 and beyond. \\n\\uf0b7Coin base Is Still a Buy. This prim er indicates to us that the use cases for \\nthe cryptomarkets will continue to grow and new projects andtokens \\nwith more and different use cases will surface. With these projects \\nattached to tokens and Coinbase a leading exchange to buy and sell\\ntokens, we see Coinbase as a leading direct beneficiary of cryptomarket \\ngrowth. 2North A merica Equity Research\\n10 January 2022Kenneth B.

Regulators have also stepped up their engagement in 2H21, but we \\nthink the market will need more from Federal US regulators to maintain the \\ninnovation momentum. \\nFor investors who want to greater insights into the cryptomarkets and some of its \\ninner workings, we offer a 101 -primer with both a discussion on how the \\ncryptomarkets work, as well as the state of the cryptocurrency markets as we see \\nthem today.  We expect the evolution of the cryptomarkets could accelerate in 2022, \\nparticularly for financial services should the promise of greater capacity and \\ntransaction speeds be delivered by upgrades to layer -1 chain Ethereum and/or new \\nlayer-2 initiatives.  \\nOur takeaway continues to be that taking the time to better understand the \\ncryptoecosystem is worth the effort. We see the likelihood that the cryptoecosyst em \\nwill be much bigger at the end of the year than it is today, and will have permeated \\nfar more of traditional finance three years from now than it has currently.  As such \\nwe see both the likelihood of more winning business models and investment \\nopportuni ties, as well as businesses that have the potential to become \\ndisintermediated.  The leading caveat to our bullish outlook remains regulation and \\nour concern that bending the existing regulatory framework to adapt to the \\ncryptoecosystem could constrain the innovation needed to better develop the \\ncryptocurrency  markets here in the US. However, we see politicians as having a far \\nbetter understanding of the cryptomarkets at year -end 2021 than they did at the \\nbeginning, an understanding thatwe think is a key i ngredient to better regulation.   \\nEvolution of the CryptoEcosystem\\nFigure 1: Timeline of Key CryptoEcosystem Milestone sin Recent Years\\nSource: Onyx by JPMorgan\\nThe cry ptoecosystem is still early in its development, being only fourteen years since \\nSatoshi Nakamoto wrote his/her/their whitepaper that jumpstarted the development \\nof Bitcoin and whi ch ultimately gave way to other developments such as Ethereum, \\nsmart contracts, tokenization, NFTs, Web3.0 and the Metaverse.  \\n4North A merica Equity Research\\n10 January 2022Kenneth B.

This technology is also the basis for communities that \\ndevelop around cryptocurrency projects, but in our view the technology \\ncomes first and is more important to the initial value creation. \\n2)The tokens are linked to blockchains. Investors with whom we have spoken \\nare far more willing to ascribe value to blockchains than they are to \\ncryptocurrencies.  There is a more easily  accepted belief that blockchain \\ntechnology has value, w hile the digital tokens are a retail driven pyramid \\nscheme.  However, the tokens and the blockchains are linked.  \\nDecentralized blockchains need a token with value to incentivize the\\nvalidation of the blockchain ― there needs to be a token and that token \\nneeds to have value in both proof -of-stake and proof -of-work.  While this \\ntoken value will fluctuate with supply and demand and thus the tokens can \\nget overvalued, a token with value is nonethele ss a necessary component of \\na decentralized blockchain. \\n3)Token value is based on the use cases for the blockchain. The value of the \\ntoken is set by the market, based on supply and demand.  Transactions on a \\nblockchain are paid in the native token and thus one needs to purchase the \\nunderlying token to transact.  For example, ERC -721 tokens (also referred \\nto as NFTs) are bought and sold with Eth (Ether) and gas prices (transaction \\nfees) are also paid in Eth. Acquiring Eth to transact in Ethereum based \\nproject s drives up the value of the Ether token. \\nThe Evolution of the CryptoEcosystem\\nWe see the development of the cryptoecosystem happening in three stages: 1) \\nBitcoin, 2) Ethereum and Smart Contracts, and 3) Tokens and the Metaverse.  Each \\ndevelopmental stage builds on the prior and with each stage there are more \\nopportunities to create new engagement and more fulsome communities, and thus \\ndevelop incremental business and revenue opportunities that didn’t exist in the past. \\nWhile we expect disintermediation, w e see the cryptomarkets more about creating \\nnew opportunities for engagement and thus more new business opportunities.  (NFTs \\nin Art Basil Miami brought out new artists and new buyers, complementing rather \\nthan disintermediating the traditional art world, for example.)\\nWe view Bitcoin as being mature in its value proposition, although adoption could \\nstill grow quite materially.  Ethereum / Smart Contract devel opment and adoption \\nalso appear to us to be quite early and depending on the impact of the merge on\\ncapacity  and transaction costs could propel the protocol to permeate gaming, \\nfinancial services, real estate and other businesses and asset classes.  We see \\ntokenization (non -fungible tokens) and the Metaverse still a t their infancy.  While \\nNFTs have represented an evolution in the art world and seem poised to infiltrate and \\nalter the gaming industry, we see NFT s and tokenization in their infancy.  We still \\nsee Web3.0 and the Metaverse as ‘ in-development.’ \\nWith this in mind, we walk through the evolution of the cryptoecosystem in more of \\na chronological order as we see each stage building on the prior.

It operates a permissionless \\nand decentralized ledger on which all Bitcoin transactions are recorded. Anyone can \\njoin and interact with the Bitcoin blockchain , and Bitcoin users can send ‘value’ from \\none account or wallet to another in matter of minutes, without the involvement of a \\nbank or financial institution. Think about transactions as emailing value to anyone or \\nanyentity  anywhere in the world, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year. \\nInherent in the bitcoin software is a hard limit cap of 21 million coins. There will \\nnever be more than that in existence and based on the current pace of mining, it will \\ntake u ntil 2140 for all the bitcoin to make it into circulation. \\nThe History of Bitcoin Starts with a White Paper with an \\nUnknown Author\\nBitcoin was created following the release of a white paper by Satoshi Nakamoto\\nwhich created an incentive structure that le d to the creation of Bi tcoin . The digital \\ncurrency  was intended to provide an alternative payment system that would operate \\nfree of central control but otherwise be used just like traditional currenc ies.From \\nhere, it has grown to be a well -recognized store of value ,with a market capitalization \\nof $871bn (as of Jan -4).  \\nFigure 2: Market Capitalization of Bitcoin Surges in 2020/2021\\n$ billion\\nSource: Bloomberg Finance L .P.and  J .P.

Transactions are verified by a network of nodes \\n(computers) through cryptography, with transaction details recorded in a public \\ndistributed ledger, the blockchain. The blockchain is a linked body of data, made up \\nof units called blocks that contain information about each and ever y transaction, \\nincluding date, time, total value, buyer and seller, and a unique identifying code for $bn$200bn$400bn$600bn$800bn$1000bn$1200bn$1400bnBitcoin Market Cap6North A merica Equity Research\\n10 January 2022Kenneth B.

It is the digital ledger of th e transaction history that \\nenables digital ownership, which we see as the genius of the cryptomarkets. Blocks \\nare created approximately every 10 minutes and contain approximately 500 \\ntransactions per block.  Bitc oin operates at ~7 TPS (transactions per sec ond), very \\nslow in terms of financial services.  The official Bitcoin software is maintained as an \\nopen -source project by Gavin Andresen , the lead Bitcoin developer at the Bitcoin \\nFoundation ,although neither has formal authority over the Bitcoin network.\\nFigure 3: Digital Representation of the Blockchain \\nSource: J.P.

By seeing the steps involved in such a \\ntransfer, we think it helps in better understanding the cryptoecosystem. \\nUnderstanding Pu blic and Private Keys –The Keys to Cryptography\\nThe transfer of bitcoin from one person to another utilizes p ublic and private keys, \\nintegral parts of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. These keys work in combination \\nto allow participants to send and rec eive cr yptocurrency without requiring a third \\nparty  like a bank to verify the transactions. The public and private keys fit together as \\na key  pair, and while o ne may  share the public key in order to receive transactions, \\nthe private key enables ownership. If anyone gains access to the private key, they \\nwill also have access to any cryptocurrency associated with those keys.\\n7North A merica Equity Research\\n10 January 2022Kenneth B.

Morgan .\\nA transaction that transfers bitcoin from wallet -1 from person -1 to another person -2 \\nin wallet -2 works something like this:\\n1.Person -1 wants to send one bitcoin to person -2. \\n2.Person -1 opens his/her wallet -1 and scans person -2’s wallet -2 to obtain the \\nwallet -2 public key, which is a series of letters and numbers that a user must \\nshare in order to receive funds. \\n3.Wallet -1 provides the private key to wallet -2, as well as the amount of Bitcoin \\nthat is going to be transferred, i n this case one bitcoin.  In addition, the sender \\nPerso n-1 will also include a mining fee that is measured in Satoris/vbyte, with \\nthe average transaction 250bytes and thus the typical fee $76 or ~15bps. \\n4.The wallet will communicate the transaction details to a node, which is any \\ncomputer (a simple PC/laptop) t hat sto res the entire bitcoin blockchain.  As of \\nthe writing of this note, there are ~12,000 bitcoin nodes that are all \\ninterconnected, and communicate with all the other nodes in the network and \\nvalidate the transaction. \\n5.Nodes will hold the verified Bitc oin transactions in a mempool (waiting area for \\nbitcoin transactions). Here, miners that have solved the complex cryptographic \\nhash puzzle (discussed in more detail later in the note) will pick up the validated \\nbitcoin transactions. Because a mempool might store 3mbs of transaction data \\nand because each bitcoin block only holds 1mb of data , the miner will s ort the \\ntransaction in the mempool typically  by the mining fee, and will add these \\nhigher fee transactions to the block and will collect both the mining fee and the \\nmining reward (6.25 bitcoin). Once the transaction is reported to the b lock, the \\ntransaction is complete. \\nAs seen in the process above, a higher transaction fee will lead to faster execution \\nsince itis more profitable for the miner.  If the m ining fee is below average, the \\ntransaction could be sorted to the bottom of the mempool and may wait unconfirmed \\n8North A merica Equity Research\\n10 January 2022Kenneth B.

Until the transaction makes it to the \\nblockchain, it is not complete. \\nPrivate keys are the foundati on of security for cryptocurrency transactions. Private \\nkeys are generated by pseudorandom number generators (PRNGs) to generate \\nthese random positive integers. Private keys for Bitcoin and Ethereum are 78 digits \\nlong with the set of numbers from which a k ey is selected so massive in size, roughly \\nthe same size as the number of visible atoms in the universe, the probabilities of \\ngenerating two of the same private keys is negligible. As of today, there have been \\nno known hacks that have allowed someone to si gn transactions without knowing the \\nprivate key. \\nThe Process of Mining and Proof of Work\\nThe bitcoin blockchain is validated via the proof -of-work protocol, a consensus \\nmechanism used to confirm that netwo rk participants (called miners) calculate valid \\nalphanumeric codes (called hashes), verify Bitcoin transactions and include them in \\nthe next block added to the blo ckchain. \\nMiners Represent the Security Mechanism for Bitcoin\\nMining was introduced as the solution to the double -spend problem. If I have 1 \\nBitcoin and I send it to someone , and then try sending that same Bitcoin to another \\nperson , the network ensures that only one transaction will be accepted. It does this \\nthrough mining. Oneof the key features of Bitcoin is itsdecentralization , operating a \\ndigital ledger securely without the involvement of a bank, government or other \\ncentral authority. But the distributed network needs a mechanism to act as the final \\narbiter, to ensure that nobody manipulates the blockchain for their own purpos e(such \\nas to double spend existing bitcoin as above ). Mining is this decentralized security \\nsystem. \\nThe Digital Ledger Allows for the Ownership of a Digital Asset\\nTo operate a decentralized digital ledger that can be trusted is a challenge, and the \\nblock chain is the best decentralized mechanism yet created and widely accepted to \\nown a digital asset.  Because digital assets can be copied exactly, the \\ndatabase/accounting ledger recorded on the blockchain for all to see and verify \\nallows one to show the tran saction history of the digital asset and ultimately to prove \\nownership. Ownership of a digital asset, an asset that can be exactly reproduced in \\ncode, is a true innovation of the blockchain and proof of work as a validation of this \\nblockchain is again an i ncredible innovation. \\nProof -of-Work –The Protocol that Validates the Blockchain\\nBitcoin uses the proof -of-work protocol to validate the blockchain, the process by \\nwhich the digital ledger is updated by adding new blocks with all the most recent \\ntransacti ons. This proof-of-work protocol is often described as solving a \\n“cryptographic puzzle. ”The underlying tech nology that powers this immutability \\nand security is cryptographic hashing. A cryptographic hash function is a \\nmathematical function that, simply pu t, takes any input and quickly maps it to a \\nfixed -size string output.  Crypt ographic hashin g is deterministic (any input will \\nalways generate the same output), fast, unique (each input with result in a random \\nand unique output such that no two inputs will ever result in the same output), and \\nirreversible (given the output of the hash function, one cannot determine the input ).\\nThe algorithm Bitcoin uses to generate the hash is called SHA -256, whichalways \\ngenerates hashes asa 256bit number, the equivalent of 64 characters.  SHA -256 is an 9North A merica Equity Research\\n10 January 2022Kenneth B. W orthington, CFA\\n(1-212) 622 -6613\\nkenneth.b.worthington@jpmorgan.com\\n     \\n          \\nadaptation of SHA -2,which was created by the NSA in 2001 .  Bitcoin\\'s proof -of-\\nwork algorithm then generates a hash for the block.  Think of a hash like a \\nfingerprint that identifi es a speci fic piece of data.\\nMining Explained\\nMining is the process duri ng which all transactions are broadcast to the network and \\nareusually confirmed within 10 -20 minutes.  Mining is a distributed consensus \\nsystem that is used to confirm pending transactions by including them in the \\nblockchain. It enforces a chronological order in the block chain, protects the \\nneutrality  of the network, and allows different computers to agree on the state of the \\nsystem. To be confirmed, transactions must be packed i n ablock thatfit very strict \\ncryptographic rules that will b e verified by the network. These rules prevent previous \\nblocks from being modified (altering the records of past transactions for example)\\nbecause doing so would easily  and visibly invalidate all the subseque nt blocks. \\nMining also creates the equivalent of a competitive lottery that prevents certain \\nminers from repeatedly /consecutively adding new blocks to the block chain. In this \\nway, no group or individuals can control what is included in the block chain or \\nreplace parts of the block chain to their advantage .\\nMiners and Rewards\\nThe process of Bitcoin mining involves specially designed computers that aggregate \\nBitcoin transactions into a block to add to the blockchain.  In exchange, the miners 1) \\ncollect trans actio n fees and 2) are paid a reward in the form of Bitcoin by the \\nnetwork.  The process starts with Bitcoin miners selecting one megabyte worth of \\ntransactions, bundling them as an input into the SHA -256 function, and attempting to \\nfind a specific output (solving the cryptographic puzzle) the network accepts. This \\npuzzle is complex and requires significant computational resources to solve.  \\nHowever once solved, the puzzle is both easy to verify as the right solution by the \\nbroader network, while also simul taneously validating all current and past \\ntransactions in the blockchain.  Think of mining as solving a complex 10,000 picture \\npuzzle on the dinner table –it is challenging to put together but once completed it is \\neasy to verify  that all the pieces have b een put together properly.  The first miner to \\nsolve the cryptographic puzzle and find this output will publish the block to the \\nnetwork and w illreceive a reward in the form of transaction fees and the creation of \\n6.25 new Bitcoin, currently valued at ~$3 25,000.  A new Bitcoin block is added \\nevery 10 minutes, which makes the business of mining a big business. We note that \\nroughly ever y four y ears, the software running on the blockchain makes it half as \\nprofitable to mine bitcoin as it r educesthe size of the block rewards.\\nThe Cryptographic Puzzle –Hash This Hash That\\nA bitcoin block contains a header and a record of all of the new transactions, \\nincluding buyer, seller, time and date of the transactions. Each block has a unique \\nheader that is comprised of s ix pieces of information: 1) client software version, 2) \\ntimestamp of the block, 3) root o f the containing transactions’ M erkle tree, 4) hash of \\nthe prio r block, 5) a nonce and 6) the target. \\nFirst –let’s start with how a Merkle tree cha rt works.  10North A merica Equity Research\\n10 January 2022Kenneth B.

Morgan .\\nThe M erkle root (at the top of Figure 5) acts as the effective summary of all of the \\ntransactions in the block.  A Merkletree is simple concept where transaction leaves\\nare hashed together using SHA -256 into parents, and parents are hashed together \\nwith those outputs again hashed until a single Merkle root,which becomes the \\nunchangeable summary of all of the transactions in the block. If one of the \\ntransactions in the b lock were changed at a later date, the output in the Merkleroot \\nwould change all the way up the tree and would be easily recognized by any \\ncomputer node looking at the root (the top hash in the graphic below.)\\nFigure 6: When a Le af in the Merkle Tree Changes, the Parent and Root Is Altered\\nSource: J.P. Morgan .\\nFinding the Correct Nonce that Leads to the Correct Block Hash\\nThe core of mining comes from the nonce and the target, which are the basis for the \\ncryptographic puzzle th at minors have to solve to create the new block. The miner is \\ntrying to find the number (the nonce) that when added to a combination of the known \\ninformation in the header including the hash of the previous block, the transaction \\nhash of the existing block , and the timestamp of the existing block can be hashed \\ntogether using SHA -256 to generate the correct 67 digit output (the correct hash \\nsignature) for the block to be included on the blockchain.  \\nhash (ABCD)Top Hash / Merkle Root\\nhash (C)Hash Parent\\nhash (D)Hash Parent\\nhash (CD)Hash Parent\\nCTransaction Leaves\\nDTransaction Leaves\\nhash (A)Hash Parent\\nhash (B)Hash Parent\\nhash (AB)Hash Parent\\nATransaction Leaves\\nBTransaction Leaves Data \\nBlocks\\nhash (ABCD)Top Hash / Merkle Root\\nhash (C)Hash Parent\\nhash (D)Hash Parent\\nhash (CD)Hash Parent\\nCTransaction Leaves\\nDTransaction Leaves\\nhash (A)Hash Parent\\nhash (B)Hash Parent\\nhash (AB)Hash Parent\\nATransaction Leaves\\nBTransaction Leaves Data \\nBlocks11North A merica Equity Research\\n10 January 2022Kenneth B.

Both the target and the output hash are incredibly large \\nnumbers. When converted to base -10, they  are 67 digits long.  So miners will hash \\nthe block header together with their guess at the nonce over and over un til they find a \\nnonce that works. For the first block, the genesis block in Bitcoin and the easiest of \\nthe cry ptographic puzzles, it took nearly 2.1bn computations to find a nonce that \\nresulted in a hash that was acceptable. It has gotten much harder since then. \\nBelow in Figure 8, we show how the block header from one block becomes a \\ncomponent of the block header for the next block .  Go back to the Merkle tree ― if \\nany old block is altered ,the entire chain is changed ,which can be easily recognized \\nby the community, which can revert back to the prior chain. \\nFigure 8: Visual Representation of the Bitcoin Blockchain and the Role of the Block Header \\nSource: J.P. Morgan.\\nOnce a miner finds a correct nonce, the calculated hash (signature) is added to the \\nblock’s header. The signature acts as a block lock, preventing further changes to the \\ntransactions stored inside the block. The ‘winning’ miner broadcasts the complete \\nblock to other nodes that verify that the nonce results in a correct hash signature. \\nOnce 50% of the nodes verify the block, a state of consensus is reached and the block \\nis considered valid and the entire network adds the block to the chain. \\nThe miner who co rrectly  publishes the block is rewarded with new bitcoin, currently \\n6.25 bitcoin. This takes place in the mining process, as miners areallowed to add an \\nadditional output transaction to the block that attributes 6.25bitcoin to themselves. \\nEvery four years , the reward for mining bitcoin will fall in half.  Sometime in early \\n2024, the reward will fall from 6.25bitcoin to 3.125 bitcoin.  Once all the bitcoin are \\nmined sometime in 2140, miners will work solely for the mining fee. \\nThe Bitcoin network protocol adjusts the algorithm’s difficulty every two weeks to \\nmaintain a 10 minute average block time. As computational power increases (i.e., \\nthe network mining capacity increases), the time to create a block falls, and the target \\n12North A merica Equity Research\\n10 January 2022Kenneth B. W orthington, CFA\\n(1-212) 622 -6613\\nkenneth.b.worthington@jpmorgan.com\\n     \\n          \\nis made more difficult. On the contrary, if computational power declines (i.e., the \\nnetwork mining capacity declines), as what happened when China banned bitcoin \\nmining last year, the target is made easier .\\nThe Value of Bitcoin \\nNothing inherently valuable underpins the bitcoin network , similar to many  of the \\nworld’s fiatcurrencies since leaving thegold standard .  However, we do see value \\ndriven by  the Bitcoin technology that enables both the concept of digital scarcity and \\nultimately its merit as a store of value. Such digital scarcity has become more \\nvaluable since the o utbreak of Covid -19 that contributed to a significant increase in \\nglobal government debt and drove some to look for alternatives to fiat currencies as \\nglobal stores of value. \\nIn our opinion, Bitcoin is particul arly well designed as a modern store of value, and \\nthe strong design has contributed to the increased confidence in and value of Bitcoin. \\nWhile many are buying cryptocurrencies (chasing in our opinion) because the \\ncryptocurrencies are appreciating and/or a re meaningfully outperforming other asset \\nclasses, we think the merits of Bitcoin will endure near -term fluctuations in value, \\nboth in terms of digital scarcity as well as a good store of value.\\nDefining a Store of Value –Eight Characteristics \\nOur resear ch indicates that there are eight characteristics that define a good store of \\nvalue.  We see Bitcoin as being distinguished in six, but disadvantaged in two.  \\nRelative to gold, we see Bitcoin is at least or more durable, portable, fungible, \\nvisible, scarce , verifiable, and free from censorship. However, Bitcoin falls short of \\ngold in its history as a store of value and we add a ninth as a greater level of price \\nvolatility . \\n\\uf0b7Durable –Bitcoin cannot be destroyed nor does it perish.  It will survive as long \\nas the network survives, which given the network is decentralized makes bitcoin \\nvery hard to destroy. Wheat, soybeans, corn and other food items have failed in \\nhistory  as stores of value because they are perishable. When comparing gold to \\nbitcoin, both are durable.\\n\\uf0b7Portable –Bitcoin is particularly easy to store and transport. Large quantities of \\nBitcoin can be transmitted all over the world nearly instantly and can be stored \\non a cell phone.  Gold is far harder and more expensive to store, transport and \\ninsure.\\n\\uf0b7Fungible –Bitcoin is fungible and is interchangeable with all other Bitcoin. Gold \\nis generally fungible and can be readily seen as better than diamonds ,which can \\nhave different qualities and s hapes that impact value. That said, gold comes in \\ndiffer ent measures of purity with 24k gold and 14k gold of different values. The \\nedge goes to Bitcoin. \\n\\uf0b7Divisible –Bitcoin is divisible out to eight decimal places, out to 1/100,000,000, \\nwhich today is worth $0.0005. Gold is divisible, but not easily accurately . \\n\\uf0b7Scarce –Bitcoin has a finite number of tokens, capped at 21mn, which will be \\nmined by ~2140.  Gold is difficult to mine and there is expected to be a finite \\namount.  However, as the price of gold rises, so does the supply. 13North A merica Equity Research\\n10 January 2022Kenneth B. W orthington, CFA\\n(1-212) 622 -6613\\nkenneth.b.worthington@jpmorgan.com\\n     \\n          \\n\\uf0b7Verifiable –Bitcoin is read ily verifiable with transactions recorded on the \\nblockchain ,which is publicly available for all to view. Gold too is verifiable, but \\ncan also be forged and its purity can be diluted ,making value more questionable.  \\n\\uf0b7Free from censorship –A censorship re sistant asset cannot be stopped or \\nconfiscated by any authority, including governments. Users are uninhibited from \\nowning or transferring value at their discretion. No entity (including developers \\nor miners) has any undue influence on a users’ Bitcoin.  As such, Bitcoin is \\ncensorship resistant and because the protocol is decentralized, it is not subject to \\nthe demand or constraints of large corpor ations or governments. Government s \\ndo and have restricted both the ownership of gold and the transfer of gold \\nthroughout history. The Gold Reserve Act of 1934 prohibited the American \\npeople from owning gold, with the exception of jewelry and certain collector’s \\ncoins. \\nWe think Bitcoin falls short of other ‘stores -of-value’ in two ways.  First, Bitcoin has \\na limited histo ry as a store of value ,having only been created in 2009.  Gold has \\nbeen used as a store of value for a t least 5,000 years and more likely at least 7,000 \\nyears as that is w hen the first know gold mine was active. Bitcoin is also volatile, \\nwith price volatility levels materially higher than other asset classes including gold, \\nthe US$, equities and commodities. Because of the evaluated price volatility versus \\nother asset classes, Bitcoin would likely not make a good currency as hi gher \\nvolatility  could u ndermine crypto as a medium of exchange, as a unit of account and \\nas a standard for deferred payments, the other recognized functions of money.  But \\neven concerns over higher volatility have been met with Bitcoin support because \\nBitcoin has been an appreci ating asset, volatile for sure, but with significant value \\nappreciation. \\nFigure 9: Bitcoin Much More Volatile than Traditional Asset Classes \\nSource: J.P.

Morgan estimates.\\nThe Transition to Ethereum\\nWhile the technology backing bitcoin is significant, we see the use cases for Bitcoin \\nas rather one-dimensional.  Bitcoin represents digital scarcity and therefore digital \\nvalue.  But cryptocurrencies made a leap beyond digital value with the development \\nof Ethereum.  If Bitcoin is digital value, Ethereum is a digital canvas or software \\nplatform that allows developers to create new crypto and traditional applications. Its \\nuse cas es are far more significant than what we see for Bitcoin.\\nEthereum and Smart Contracts –Stage 2 \\n–dApps T ake Form\\nEthereum was launched in 2014 and it has become a further evolution in \\nthedesign of and thinking about cryptocurrency networks. It is a more funct ional and \\ngeneral computation protocol that draws upon concepts from Bitcoin to \\ncreate application -based blockchain transactions, meaning it provides more functions \\nthan just account -based sending and receiving. It utilizes blockchain technology  not \\nonly for maintaining a decentralized pay ment network but also for storing computer \\ncode that can be used to power tamper -proof decentralized financial contracts and \\napplicati ons.  So while Bitcoin is characterized as a virtual decentralized currency  \\nbest recognized as a store of value, Ethereum is a decentralized software platform \\noff of which developers leverage smart contracts to develop decentralized \\napplications and fungible/non -fungible tokens. \\nHistory of Ethereum –Building on the Base Created by \\nBitcoin\\nEthereum was created by Vitalik Buterin in 2014. (Here is a link to his w hite \\npaper Ethereum white paper published in 2013.)  Ethereum is the blockchain and \\nEther (Eth) is the token, although most refer to Ether as Eth. Vitalik became \\ninterested in Bitcoin in 2011, co -founded Bitcoin Magazine in September of that year \\nand remained immersed in all topics Bitcoin for two years. He wrote his Ethereum \\nwhite paper in Nov 2013 to build Ethereum as a blockchain based platform that could \\nbe programm ed for many more applications than what Bitcoin could do as a peer -to-\\npeer currency.

It is often referred to as the ‘chai n-of-chains’ because it is the base -chain or \\nbuilding block for other tokens. Like other cryptocurrencies, Ethereum works on a \\nblockchain network and is therefore a decentralized, distributed public ledger on \\nwhich transactions are recorded and verified. L ike Bitcoin, Ethereum utilizes the \\nproof -of-work protocol to validate its blockchain. But there are some key differences \\nbetween Bitcoin and Ethereum. Ether block time is faster (Ether transactions are \\nconfirmed in seconds while Bitcoin transactions take m inutes). Ether uses a different \\nprocessing algorithm with Bitcoin transactions run off the SHA -256 and Ethereum \\nEtash. While Ethereum currently runs on proof -of-work, it will convert to proof -of-\\nstake mid -2022, a change that we expect could alter the crypt ocurrency  landscape, as \\nwe discuss further below.\\nA most significant difference between Bitcoin and Ethereum is that Ethereum is \\nprogrammable and the Ethereum network can perform computations. It is this \\ncomputatio nal capability that turns what is a store of value and medium of exchange \\nfor Bitcoin into a global computing engine and openly verifiable data store in \\nEthereum. Ethereum as a programmable network allows for self -executing contracts \\n(smart contracts) with agreements programmed right into the Ethe reum blockchain.\\nEthereum operates under and benefits from three characteristics:\\n\\uf0b7Large Decentralized Network –Ethereum is the largest cryptocurrency \\necosystem and has a significant community committed to the protocol. As such \\nthere are significant number s of smart contracts that have already been written \\nand vetted by blockchain engineers in Solidity (Ethereum’s programming \\nlanguage) that can be integrated or expanded into new blockchain solutions. In \\naddition, Ethereum h as been tested with billions of do llars of transactio nsand \\nthus operates with significant credibility .This draws even more programmers \\nand users to the Ethereum network.   $bn$100bn$200bn$300bn$400bn$500bn$600bn$700bn$800bn$900bnMarket Cap of Top 20 Coins16North A merica Equity Research\\n10 January 2022Kenneth B.

Ethereum’s decentralized \\nnetwork promises to let users leave behind third -party intermediaries, like \\nlawy ers who write and interpret contracts, banks that are intermediaries in \\nfinancial transactions or third -party web hosting services.\\n\\uf0b7Upgrades of the Functionality ‒A large community of Ethereum developers is \\nlooking for ways to improve the network and develop new applications. \\nEthereum is an evolving blockchain. Recent upgrade s(discussed in a separate \\npiece of research on the London Hard Fork )introd uced the ability to burn tokens \\nand limit Ethereum mining driv en inflation, for example .  However, the most \\nradical change is expected mid-2022 when Ethereum is expected to migrate from \\nProof -of-Work to Proof -of-Stake . \\nEthereum –the Chain of Chains Drives New Applications \\nBecause Ethereum is programmable, there ar e significant applications that have been \\ndeveloped using the Ethereum technology.  This begins with sm art contracts through \\nto dApps and fungible/non -fungible tokens.  We see five general uses for Ethereum.\\n\\uf0b7Currency: Similar to Bitcoin, you can send and receive Eth or pay for goods \\nand services. As such, Eth (Ether) can be a store of value. \\n\\uf0b7Smart contracts: Ethereum allows for the development of smart contracts, \\npermissionless applications that automatically execute when the contract’s \\nconditio ns have been met.  It is these smart -contracts that are the basis for the \\nother applications described below.  \\n\\uf0b7Digital apps, or dApps :Ethereum powers digital apps that allow users to play \\ngames, invest, send money, track an i nvestment portfolio, follow social media \\nand more. Currently, over 440,000 ERC -20 tokens have been developed on \\nEthereum. \\n\\uf0b7Non-fungible tokens :The majority of NFTs are p owered by Ethereum and can \\nallow artists or others to sell art or other items directly to buyers using smart \\ncontracts. NFTs are ERC -721, non -fungible tokens. The bonus here is that one \\ncan build a royalty structure right into the blockchain, empowering th e content \\ncreator.\\n\\uf0b7Decentralized finance: By using Ethereum, some people may be able to avoid \\ncentralized (government, bank) control ove r the movement of money or other \\nassets. DeFi is trying to put the central functions of financial services companies \\non the blockchain, essentially cutting out the bank/broker/exchange as the \\nfinancial intermediary with the promise of greater speed, lower cost and greater \\nsecurity . \\nSmart Contracts on Ethereum \\nSmart contracts are the base on which dApps , NFTs and DeFi are created. A smart \\ncontract refers to a piece of computer program that gets executed by a quorum of \\nblockchain nodes and often facilitate the exchange of money, share or property. At \\ntheir core, smart contracts are executable programs used to automate the ex ecution of \\nan agreement on the blockchain without the need for intermediaries. 17North A merica Equity Research\\n10 January 2022Kenneth B. W orthington, CFA\\n(1-212) 622 -6613\\nkenneth.b.worthington@jpmorgan.com\\n     \\n          \\nSmart contracts are essentially automated agr eements, written in code and baked into \\nthe blockchain, making them immutable as well as irreversible. They contain terms \\nand condi tions of a mutually agreed contract and can define rules like a regular \\ncontrac t, but that is automatically enforced via the code. Smart contracts are not \\nlegally  binding the way traditional contracts are. Yet, smart contracts are powerful \\nbecause they can increase the speed, accuracy, and integrity in payment and \\nperformance transac tions.  Once executed, the smart contract cannot be altered. Yet \\nthe ability for Ethereum to support the development of smart contracts is key in the \\nfurther development of Decentralized Applications including fungible and non -\\nfungible tokens and ultimatel y decentralized finance , discussed further below. \\nIn Figure 12 below, we show that smart contracts are based on program functions, \\nwith inputs processed to create outputs. The logic inside smart contracts determine if \\na transaction is valid, with valid tr ansactions result ingin updated blockchain state, \\nwith invalid transactions rejected by the network from being included. The example \\nof an invalid transaction would be the spending of tokens without a sufficient \\nbalance. \\nFigure 12: Smart Contracts\\nSource: Kaleido.\\nFigure 13: Smart Contracts\\nSource: Ethereum.org and J.P.

The number of dApps \\nhasgotten big with more than 3600 dApps spanning different industries such as \\ngaming, financial services and social media. They are growing in relevan ceand are \\nestimated to be responsible for nearly $200 billion worth (and growing) of user \\ntransactions annually. \\ndApps are decentralized applications, similar to normal apps ,but run on peer -to-peer \\nnetworks like blockchains.  As such, dApps are open -sourc e and operate without one \\nentity  controlling its data , with records that are publicly available and use a \\ncryptographic token to keep the network secure.  dApps are built by combining a \\nuser interface front -end and smart contract back -end.  \\ndApp =Front-end+Smart Contract Back-end\\nIn dApps , the fro nt-end can be programmed in any language, but w ill call aback-end \\nwritten into the blockchain.  In terms of front -end user experience, dApps appear \\nnearly  identical to tradit ionalweb applications. However on the back -end, dApps\\nfunction much differently than their conventional counterparts. Instead of employing \\nthe HTTP protocol to communicate with the b roader network, dApps connect to the \\nblockchain in a decentralized manner rather than routing through cen tralized servers. \\nWe see the power of dApps is their decentralization, which makes them both free \\nfrom cens orship and easier to create. dApps are characterized by:\\n\\uf0b7Open source : The code is public for anyone to look at, copy and audit.\\n\\uf0b7Decentralization : dApps don’t have anyone in charge, so no central authority \\ncan stop users from doing what they want on the app.\\n\\uf0b7No Downtime: After deploying thesmart contract ontheblockchain, the\\nnetwork canalways serve theneeds ofclients whowant tointeract with the\\nsmart contract. Furthermore, dApps canalsoensure thatanymalicious actors\\ncannot launch denial -of-service attacks onspecific apps. Itwillcontinue to\\nfunction even ifparts ofthenetwork architecture arenon-functional.\\n\\uf0b7Censorship Free: Decentralized apps donotallow control ofthedata and\\nprocesses toasingle entity.Therefore, itisimpossible foranygovernment or\\nentity toblock users from submitting transactions ordeploying dApps, andeven\\nreading data from theblockchain. Without anyspecifi cindividual or\\norganizatio ncontrolling adApp ,users have theadvantage ofcomplete freedom\\nwith dApps.\\n\\uf0b7Private : You would find that a major share of decentralized applications does \\nnot demand the real identity of users. Rather than going through a complicated \\nand lengthy signup process, users could access dApps with their Ethereum login \\ncredentials and a digital wallet.\\n\\uf0b7Data Integrity: With the power of cryptography , decentralized applications \\nensure the secure storage of data on relevant blockchai n networks. Furthermore, \\nthe accessibility of public blockchain for verify ing transactions also provides the \\nassurance of reliability in data records.19North A merica Equity Research\\n10 January 2022Kenneth B.

Ethereum makes dApp \\ndevelopment easier by offering a development interface that reduces programming \\ntime and helps projects quickly launch. In addition, the Ethereum developer \\ncommunity has grown significant ly since the platform’s launch with a network that \\nshares code and ideas. Ethereum also retains formidable network effects from its \\nglobal coalition of technologists who remain committed to maintaining the network \\nand actively developing user resources tha t drive adoption. The ability to monetize \\nDApp projects incentivizes others to par take in the Ethereum ecosystem.\\nEthereum also uses a network -native language Solidity for coding smart contracts. \\nBut the network architecture eliminates the need to develop an entirely new \\nblockchain for ever y dApp. Once a smart contract is created, it is uploaded to the \\nEthereum Virtual Machine (EVM) ,which is a runtime compiler that executes the \\nsmart contract code. EVM is operated in what is called a ‘sandbox’ environment ,\\nwhich is isolated from the main n etwork to create an optimal testing environment. \\nOnce the code is on the EVM, everyone part of the Ethereum network has a copy of \\nthe contract. Once the smart contract is tested and verified ,it is uploaded to the \\nEthereum Mainnet.  \\nDevelopers can work with the ready -made Ethereum system to fast -track o nboarding \\nand get their applications up and running sooner than other alternatives. By \\ncombining application templates and the EVM, the overall Ethereum development \\nkit allo ws companies to focus on refining their applications and developing on top of \\nopen -source code among a global, mission -based developer community.\\ndApps and Tokenization\\nWe see tokenization as one of the major foundations of Ethereum. Tokenization is a \\nfeature used to define smart contracts and is acore element in dApps. But when we \\nrefer to tokens, there are two standards that have emerged on Ethereum ‒ERC -20 \\nand ERC -721. (The ERC stands for Ether eum Request for Comment, which i s the \\nsystem that allows for comments onthe standardization of Ethereum tokens and \\nfeatures a standard set of rules for creating tokens. ) As we reflect back, we see a \\nnumber of references to 2021 as the year of the NFT. To us, it is just the beginning of \\ntokenization. \\nERC -20 vs. E RC-721 Tokens\\nThere are two main token standards for Ethereum tokens.  At their most basic level, \\nERC -20 tokens are fungible tokens and are used for all smart contracts on the \\nEthereum blockchain.  Examples include BinanceCoin (BNB) ,the fourth largest \\ntoken by  market cap at $78bn, Stablecoins Tether and USDC ,which have a \\ncombined market cap of $ 121bn.  ERC -721 are non -fungible tokens (NFTs) ,which\\narea type of unique digital certificate, registered on a blockchain that can be used to \\nrecord ownership of any asset, best known for digital collectibles. While ERC -20 \\ntokens represent a single asset and are interchangeable, ERC -721 tokens are \\nindivisible and represent a collection of assets. Examples here including \\nCryptoKitti es, Etheremons, Crypto Bots, and B lockchain Cuties.20North A merica Equity Research\\n10 January 2022Kenneth B. W orthington, CFA\\n(1-212) 622 -6613\\nkenneth.b.worthington@jpmorgan.com\\n     \\n          \\nFigure 14: ERC -20 vs. ERC -721\\nSource: 101 Blockchain and J.P. Morgan.\\nERC -20 –The Fungible Tokens\\nERC -20 was created by Fabian Vogelsteller in 2015 and is the standard for creating \\nfungible tokens that are comp atible with the broader Ethereum network. ERC -20 \\ntokens are built on the Ether eum blockchain and adhere to a set of standards that \\nallow the tokens to work with all other Ethereum smart contracts, enabling the \\nexchange of one ERC -20 token for another and allowing the easy i ntegration with \\nother smart c ontracts, wallets, or marketplace s. ERC -20 smart contracts use ERC -20 \\ntokens to make payments when their protocol calls for it. Any smart contract that \\ninvolves pa yments will therefore pay the user in the for m of an ERC -20 token. \\nMany  dApps built o n Ethereum have their own cryptocurrencies or “tokens.” As of \\nAugust, there were over 440,000 ERC -20 tokens on Ethereum’s main network across \\nmore than 900 projects.  ERC -20 tokens are typically sold via a variety o f different \\nofferings as a way to raise early -stage capital for the underlying project. Many of the \\nprojects raised money in the initial coin offering boom of 2017.\\n21North A merica Equity Research\\n10 January 2022Kenneth B.

Morgan.\\nIn order to interact with the dApps, users need to purchase the dApp’s native token. \\nOne purchases an Ethereum -based NFT using the ETH token, for example. Generally \\nspeaking, a token represents something specific in a given ecosystem. This could be \\neconomic value, a dividend, a stake, a voting right , really anything. It’s important to \\nunderstand that a token is not limited to one particular role; it can fulfill various \\ndifferent of roles in its native ecosystem.  That said, the most common u se for tokens \\nis to transact. T here are three types of blockchain -based tokens that we will discuss:\\n\\uf0b7Usage tokens: A token that is required to use a service. These are the tokens that \\nfunction like a currency in their respective dApps. This is generally th e most \\nsimple and straightforward application of a token. These tokens have monetary \\nvalue , but don’t come with any sort of rights or privilege within the particular \\nnetwork.\\n\\uf0b7Work tokens: A token that gives users the right to contribute work to a DAO \\nand e arn in exchange for their work. In this model, the user (or service provider) \\nstakes the native token of the network to earn the right to perform work for the \\nnetwork. Given a fixed supply of tokens, service providers will rationally pay \\nmore per token for the right to earn part of a growing cash flow stream. The \\nimportant thing to understand at this stage is that work tokens grant access to the \\nnetwork and provide cash flow potential conditional on the deliver y of work \\nwith the token .\\n\\uf0b7Security tokens: An external, tradable asset that is a representation of value in a \\nsystem. Security  tokens, also known as tokenized securities or investment \\ntokens, are financial securities compliant with SEC regulations. What makes \\nsecurity tokens so neat (and potentially re volutionary) is that the rights are \\nwritten into a smart contract and the tokens are traded o n a blockchain -powered \\nexchange –24/7/365 with near instant settlement.\\n22North A merica Equity Research\\n10 January 2022Kenneth B.

In return, investors receive newly minted tokens \\nprior to the official launch at wholesale prices.\\n\\uf0b7Voting rights: Tokens can be used for voting on project decisions. In this \\ninstance, the more tokens users have ,the more influence they have over each \\nelection.\\n\\uf0b7Represent physical objects: Atoken can represent ownership of assets, such as \\ngold.\\n\\uf0b7New features: Sometimes builders need a token for paying for the functionality \\nof their projects, but the native token on Ethereum, Eth, is not enough for them. \\nSo, they  create a new token with the fu nctionality they need.\\nERC -721 T okens --NFTs\\nThe ERC -721 Token standard enables Non -Fungible Tokens (NFTs) on the Ethereum \\nblockchain. J ust like the ERC -20 token standard helps in creating fungible tokens, the \\nERC -721 focuses on non -fungible asset s. ERC -721 tokens help bring the concept of \\nuniqueness to the blockchain, ensuring that distinctive details about an asset can be \\nimmortalized. NFTs can be used to provide digital representation of a one -of-a-kind \\nartwork, with ownership that is easily proved thro ugh blockchain records and can \\nlimit things like counterfeiting.\\nThe Ethereum Foundation describes the workings of an NFT like this.  An NFT has \\none owner at a time, which is managed through the uniqueID and metadata that no \\nother token can replicate. NFTs are minted through smart contracts that assign \\nownership and manage the transferability. When an NFT is created, the creator \\nexecutes code stored in smart contracts that conform to a certain standard, such as \\nERC -721, and th is information is added to the blockchain where the NFT is being \\nmanaged. The minting process, from a high level, has the following ste ps that it goes \\nthrough:\\n\\uf0b7Creating a new block$bn$50bn$100bn$150bn$200bn$250bn$300bn$350bn$400bn$450bn$500bn\\n4Q18 2Q19 4Q19 2Q20 4Q20 2Q21 4Q21Market Cap of ETH vs  25 Largest ERC -20 Tokens\\nEthereum Top 2523North A merica Equity Research\\n10 January 2022Kenneth B.

While we discuss the implications later in \\nthe note, some key properties are as follows.  \\n1.Each NFT has a unique identifier that is directly linked to one Ethereum \\naddress.\\n2.NTFs are not directly interchangeable with other tokens 1:1. For example 1 \\nETH is exactly the same as another ETH. This isn\\'t the case with NFTs. \\n3.Each token has an owner and this information is easily verifiable.  Here, the \\ntoken proves that the copy of t he digital file is the original and the private \\nkey is proof -of-ownership of the original.  The content creator\\'s public key \\nserves as a certificate of authenticity for that particular NFT. \\n4.They  live on Ethereum and can be bought and sold on any Ethereum -based \\nNFT market.\\nCurrent use cases for NFTs are in digital entertainment including art and music, but\\nare increasingly being used as assets in gaming. We expect NFTs will become a key \\npart of DeFi with the tokenization of particular value for ill iquid assets.  Below we \\nshow a compare and contrast between the current internet and an NFT internet, \\nwhich is presented by the Ether eum Organization. \\nTable 1: The NFT Internet vs. the Internet Today –A Compare and Contrast\\nAn NFT Internet The Internet Today\\nNFTs are digitally unique, no two NFTs are the \\nsame.A copy of a file, like an .mp3 or .jpg is the same as \\nthe original.\\nEvery NFT must have an owner and this is of public \\nrecord and easy for anyone to verify.Ownership records of digital items are stored on \\nservers controlled by institutions -you must take their \\nword for it.\\nNFTs are compatible with anything built using \\nEthereum.

Morgan.\\nThe Downside of Ethereum –Getting More Congested and \\nExpensive \\nEthereum’s success and popularity have created a number of problems for the \\nnetwork. With increasing numbers of fungible and non -fungible tokens running on \\nEthereum, network congestion have driven gas prices /transaction fees to rise \\nmaterially for Ether eum based transactions, making it expensive to transact on the \\nnetwork. It can regularly cost $40 -$50 per transaction, making the purchase of simple \\nNFTs or th e movement of Ethereum from one wallet to another an expensive \\nproposition. Ethereum is also energy intensive and doesn\\'t communicate well with \\nother blockchains. It\\'s a bit like having a cellphone that can only textusers o n the \\nsame network. Ultimately E thereum’s problem has been its limited ability to scale \\nwith the increasing popularity of the network. \\nLack of Scalability\\nOne of the core problems with the Ethereum platform has been scalability. As more \\nand more decentralized apps use the platform, and transactions increase \\nexponentially, so do the gas fees. Simply put, if there are too many users on the \\nblockchain, it gets more expensive to buy and sell things.\\nIncrease Cost to Transact on Ethereum –Rising Transaction Costs\\nEthereum’s growing popularit y has led to higher transaction costs. Ethereum \\ntransaction fees, also known as “gas,” have been rising for much of 2021 . When we \\ntried to buy NFTs for the kids for presents this holiday season, weended up paying \\nmore in gas fees than in NFT prices.  Whil e in Bitcoin the network itself rewards \\ntransaction verifiers, Ethereum requires those participating in the transaction to cover \\nthe fee.  In Ethereum\\'s current state, only those with larger holdings can make use of \\nthe benefits of its ecosystem. Swapping cryptocurrencies on Uniswap, a \\ndecentralized exchange and liquidity provider on Ethereum\\'s network, costs nearly  \\n$150 earlier this year, making trading small amounts of money impractical .$1mn $6mn $18mn$13bn\\n$bn$2bn$4bn$6bn$8bn$10bn$12bn$14bn\\n2018 2019 2020 2021OpenSea Transaction Volume25North A merica Equity Research\\n10 January 2022Kenneth B.

Processing transactions on Ethereum network requires computational \\npower and gas is the fee paid to miners for providing that computational power. Gas \\nfees are measured in Gwei, the smallest base unit of ETH ‒1/1,000,000,000 of an \\nETH . Gas fees were created to both compensate and incentivize the miners to \\nundertake the computational costs of using the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) to \\nexecute the transaction.  But Gas fees also help keep the Ethereum network secure. \\nAttaching cost to every transaction prevents spamming or accidental infinity loops \\nthat could un intentionally or maliciously con sume the resources of Ethereum and \\nprevent new transactions from being recorded. More complex transactions require \\nmore gas to execute, with t ransactions involving smart contracts costing more than \\ntransfers of ETH between two wallets. Average daily gas prices in Dec 2021 have \\nranged from a low of $62 on Dec 19 to a high of $156 on Dec 4. Because transaction \\nfees need to be paid in Eth, particip ants on the Ethereum blockchain need to acquire \\nETH ,which results in value for ETH.\\nFigure 18: Eth Gas Prices Remains High\\nSource: ycharts.com\\nEthereum Suffers from Slower Transaction Speeds\\nEthereum runs at 15 transactions per second. This is faster than Bitcoin’s 7tps, but is \\nsubstantially slower than the Mas terCard’s network, for example that can process \\n5,000tps. Ethereum transaction speeds are being hurt by a number of factors \\nincluding greater data store needs given the inc reased usage of Ethereum and the \\nneed to drive consensus with an increasing number of nodes.

SOL has over \\n400 projects running on its ecosyste m, including stablecoins like Circle’s USD. \\nIt also runs wallets, decentralized exchanges, and other decentralized finance \\nprojects .\\n\\uf0b7Cardano -Cardano was launched by one of Ethereum’s co -founders, Charles \\nHoskinson. It has taken a research -intensive appro ach to the development, with\\neach stage peer -reviewed and thoroughly tested before implementation. Cardano \\nis now also launching its smart contract capabilities. This third -generation \\ncryptocurrency is considered more scalable than Ethereum.\\n\\uf0b7Polkadot -Polkadot aims to solve some of Ethereum’s scalability and cost \\nissues. But Polkadot shines in its interoperability capabilities as it enables \\nblockchains to communicate effectively. This approach also makes it easier for \\ndevelopers to switch to Polkadot’s sys tem. \\n\\uf0b7Tezos -Tezos is a us er-focused, open -source project that allows users to weigh \\non project governance and the direction of the blockchain .In addition , Tezos \\nprovides well-regarded security andmodularity, and is viewed as more scalable .\\n\\uf0b7Others Layer -1 Chains –Other Layer -1 chains viewed as the collections of \\nEthereum Killers includes A valanche, Zcash, Binance Coin, Near Pro tocol, \\nStellar and Chainlink.\\nLayer -2 Solutions and Rollups\\nLayer-2 blockchains are essentially overlay networks that lay on top of the \\nunderlying Layer -1 blockchain s.Layer -2 on Ethereum chains help scale an \\napplication by processing transactions off of the Ethereum Mainnet (layer 1) while \\nstill maintaining the same security measures and decentralization as the mainnet. \\nLayer2 solutions can increase throughput (transaction speed) and can reduce gas \\nfees, but can keep transactions secure , speedy, and decentralized.$bn$50bn$100bn$150bn$200bn$250bn$300bn$350bn$400bn$450bn$500bn\\n2020Q1 2020Q2 2020Q3 2020Q4 2021Q1 2021Q2 2021Q3 2021Q4Market Cap\\nETH Ethereum Killers28North A merica Equity Research\\n10 January 2022Kenneth B.

Inheriting \\nthe security properties of layer -1 while perfor ming execution outside of layer -1 is a \\ndefining characteristic of rollups.\\nThere are two categories of layer -2 rollups: optimistic and zero -knowledge. While both \\nhave their advantages and disadvantages, both execute transactions offchain but post \\ntransaction data on lay er-1. Examples of Layer -2s are below. \\n\\uf0b7Polygon -It is an em erging platform meant to develop and connect Ethereum -\\nbased blockchain networks . It features tools and components used by developers \\nto create optimize d Ethereum instances. Also, the platform provides an \\nimprovement in flexibility for developers and the security of Ethereum. \\n\\uf0b7Arbitrum -It is another Layer 2 solution with features meant for close \\ninteroperability with Ether eum. These features make it easy for Solidity \\ndevelopers to cross -compile their smart contracts. The three components of \\nArbitum include a compiler, the EthBridge and validators. Arbitum does not \\nfeature a native token.\\n\\uf0b7Optimism -This is an example of an Ethereum scaling solution that provide s\\nimprovements to transaction affordability. It can also ensure meaningful \\nimprovements in transaction speed for Ethereum users. Developers here can \\ncreate Solidity smart contracts.\\n\\uf0b7Immutable -X-Immutable -X is a Layer 2 scaling solution for NFTs on \\nEthereum. It provides instant trade confirmation, zero gas fees, scalability and \\nprovides this without compromising user custody. \\n\\uf0b7X-Dai-is a sidechain based on Ether eum and supports users in process ing \\ntransactions at economical costs and faster speeds. The platform uses a PoS \\nconsensus mechanic to help users place native xDAI tokens as stakes on the \\nnetworks. The most enticing part about xDAI is that it is a stablecoin.\\nMaking Ethereum Better --The Ethereum Merge\\nEthereum is undertaking a significant upgrade that is expected to improve the \\nperformance and scalability of Ethereum. The upgrade, re ferred to as the Ethereum \\nMerge ,has been long delayed, but is expected to be executed mid -2022 and will \\nconvert Ethereum from a proof -of-work to proof -of-stake. It will ultimately set \\nEthereum for greater scalability, greater transaction speeds and lower transaction \\ncosts. \\nThe more immediate benefits of the merge come from the migration to the Proof -of-\\nStake protocol ,which will drive an immediate improvement in energy efficiency, \\ndecentralization and security. Over time, there is the potential for improvements \\nin transaction speeds from ~ 15 transactions per second today to potentially 100,000 \\nTPS, acc ording to Ethereum founder, Vitalik Buterin. For a primer on Staking \\nincluding a discussion on the Ethereum merge, see our note.29North A merica Equity Research\\n10 January 2022Kenneth B.

Morgan.\\nEthereum The Evolving Blockchain --The Ethereum Foundation \\nWe see Ethereum as an Evolving Blockchain that undergoes a number of key \\nupgrades each year .  With other blockchains like B itcoin largely static with just one \\nupgrade in the last four years, Ethereum supports numerous upgrades.  Governance is \\ninformal for Ethereum and happens off -chain. Upgrades to the core Ethereum \\nblockchain are proposed via Ethereum Improvement Proposals (E IPs) that specify \\nnew features or processes for Ethereum. The Ethereum Foundation operates as a non-\\nprofit organization that promotes and supports research, developme nt, and education \\nto produce decentralized applications ,hosts a nallcoredevs call where E IPs are \\nproposed and debated. Participants on allcoredevs calls include develop ers from the \\nEthereum Foundation, researchers from other organizations (including Consensys, \\nNethermind, Sigma Prime, Prysematic Labs) and other volunteers.  EIPs are \\nconsidered , debated, championed, tested, and if all goes well are ultimately \\nimplemented on the Ethereum mainnet. \\nThere were four upgrades of the Ethereum blockchain in 2021, including Berlin in \\nApril, London in August, Altair in October, and Arrow Glacier in Decem ber. The \\nLondon Hark Fork included EIP -1559 that takes a portion of gas fees in Eth that \\nwere paid to miners and ‘burns’ them, thus eliminating supply of Eth and reducing \\ninflation.  EIP -1559 also incorporated variable block sizes that are up to 2x larger to \\nhelp with capacity issues.  The London upgrade included other proposals EIP -3554, \\nEIP-3529, EIP -3198 and EIP -3541 that will help facilitate the transition to proof -of-\\nstake and the Ethereum merge expected in mid -2022.\\nWhat Is Happening in the Ethereum M erge \\nThe Ethereum merge refe rs to merger between the current Ethereum mainnet (PoW) \\nwith the Ethereum Beacon Chain (PoS).  The Beacon Chain has been running in \\nparallel to Ethereum Mainnet since Dec 1, 2020. To facilitate the migration from \\nEthereum Mainn et to the Ethereum Beacon Chain, a mechanism called a difficulty \\nbomb wi lldetonate ,making mining unprofitable todisincentivizing miners from \\nkeeping the chain alive after the network merges , and should/ will ultimately \\nrepresent th e end of the Ethereum Mainnet.

W orthington, CFA\\n(1-212) 622 -6613\\nkenneth.b.worthington@jpmorgan.com\\n     \\n          \\nBenefits of Ethereum 2.0 and the Beacon Chain\\n1)Less Energy Consumption –Ethereum is expected to use 99.95% less energy \\nwhen it converts to proof -of-stake following the merge. When Ethereum \\nconverts to proof -of-stake, the sel ection process to validate the blockchain will \\nmigrate f rom solving the cryptographic puzzles to token ownership. Those that \\nown mo re Ethereum and/or own it longer will have a greater chance of adding \\nblocks to the Ethereum blockchain and earn a reward.  T he software required to \\nvalidate an Ethereum block in proof -of-stake can be done on a laptop with \\nexpected electricity costs of $150/year.  The proof -of-work protocol used to \\nvalidate the Bitcoin and Ethereum blockchains consumes significant energy as \\nmine rs seek to calculate the nonce. Currently Ethereum mining is estimated to \\nconsume ~44.5TWh/year in aggregate, on the magnitude of the energy Honduras \\nconsumed in 2016. \\n2)Ethereum scalability –Ethereum 2.0 plans to scale its capacity by using a \\nmethod calle d sharding, that is hoped/expected will greatly increase \\ntransaction speeds, potentially scaling its ability to 100,000 transactions per \\nsecond or more. Sharding is a way to partition a database into smaller pieces , \\nspreading execution into 64 new shard ch ains that are more manageable. With a \\nPoW blockchain, most nodes, or co mputers in the network, have an entire copy \\nof the history of transactions. This entire history can take up a lot of space, \\nespecially  for older cryptocurrencies with a long history of transactio ns. With \\nsharding on PoS, the blockchain is cut up into parallel sections, and nodes are \\nassigned to one section instead of having to hold the entirety of the chain\\'s data. \\nThis allows more transactions to be processed simultaneously, greatly in creasing \\nthroughput and transaction speed. Sharding is expected a fter the Ethereum \\nmerge, toward year-end 2022 or 2023. \\n3)Ethereum Deflation –We believe that Ethereum issuance could be deflationary \\nfollowing the merge. Inflation take splace when new tokens are mined (in the \\ncase of proof -of-work) or minting (in the case of proof -of-stake) as part of the \\nrewards given to those that are adding blocks and validating the blockchains. \\nHowever, we estimate that the migration from proof -of-work to proof -of-stake \\ncombined with the burn introduced in EIP -1559 could drive Ethereum to \\ndeflation and negative token issuance. We estimate that Ethereum’s inflation rate \\nwas ~4.2% annually prior to the implementation of EIP -1559. Block rewards of \\n2 Eth for mining Ethereum blocks resulted in ~13,000Eth created each day \\n@2eth x 6,500 blocks/day.  However, EIP-1559 is driving Eth to be burne d \\n(taken out of existence) as a portion of the gas fee is now burnt rather than paid \\nto the miner s.  We note that s ince the introduction of EIP -1559, Eth issuance has \\ndeclined 66% and when transaction activity is particularly elevated, Eth can be \\ndeflationary . \\nTable 2: Burned Rewards since the Introduction of EIP -1559 through Jan 3, 2022\\nETH USD Equivalent\\nBurned 1,342,310 $4,964,190,183\\nRewards 2,031,053 $7,511,321,476\\nTips 249,467 $922,587,702\\nNet Issuance 688,743 $2,547,138,435\\nSource: watchtheburn.com and J.P.

W orthington, CFA\\n(1-212) 622 -6613\\nkenneth.b.worthington@jpmorgan.com\\n     \\n          \\nWe expect that following the merge that Ethereum will enter a deflationary period.  \\nThe rewards for miners total 2 -Eth per block, ~4.8mn Eth created each year.  \\nHowever, rewards for proof -of-stake appear far lower for validators, ~0.0052Eth.  \\nThis lower re ward is justified by the far lower resources that validation required \\nunder proof -of-stake.  But it also means that with far lower block rewards under \\nproof -of-stake that the burn will likely result in deflation, which depending on \\ntransaction levels and g as-prices could burn 1 -2mn Eth/year. \\nWhat\\'s Next for CryptoCurrencies\\nWe think it important to think about outlook for the cryptomarkets based on use \\ncases and potential.  We are confident only in that we’re probably not doing justice to \\nall the potentia l applications that those tech savvy and creative entrepreneurs will \\ndevelop in the coming years.  Some/much of this potential will be based on \\nimprovements in both layer -1 and lay er-2 chains and most importantly more \\ncertainty  around regulation.  We concl ude this note by walking through a bit more in \\ndepth about Web3.0, NFTs, DeFi and the companies that we have encountered in the \\ncryptoecosystem with some help from our J.P. Morgan crypto colleagues Christine \\nMoy and Stoyan Djourov who run Onyx by JPMorgan, J.P. Morgan’s blockchain \\nbusiness.\\nFrom Web2.0 to Web3.0 –Crypto’s Contribution\\nWe are using the web differently today than we did twenty years ago, and we will \\nuse it differently twenty years in the future, wesuspect.  We start with a description \\nof Web3.0 and a brief overview of the earlier world -wide -web.\\n\\uf0b7Web1.0 –The Web was for consumers of content and wasoften referred to as \\nthe read -only web.  T he creators were typically developers who built websites \\nthat contained information served up mainly in text or image format. Web 1.0 \\nlasted approximately from 1991 to 2004. \\n\\uf0b7Web2.0 –Web2.0 is often referred to as the read/write web.  The Web beca me a \\nplatform and applications were built on the web rather than on desktops.  \\nWeb2.0 gave us more content creation on social networks, blogs, sharing sites \\nand more. One didn’t / doesn’t have to be a developer to participate in the \\ncreation process. If you want to upload a video and allow millions of people to \\nsee it, in teract with it, and comment on it, you can do that in Web2.0 .Web 2.0’s \\ninternet was a massive app store, dominated by centralized apps from Google, \\nFacebook and Amazon where monetizations took place via targeted advertising.  \\nHowever, Web2.0 is plagued wi th secur ity and data breaches since in W eb2.0, \\nyou don’t have any control over your data or how it is stored.\\n\\uf0b7Web3.0 –Web3.0 is the read/w rite/intelligence web.  It repr esents a smarter \\ninternet.  Web 3.0 enables a future where distributed users and machin es are able \\nto interact with data, value and other counterparties via a substrate of peer -to-\\npeer networks without the need for third parties. Decentralization is a key part of \\nWeb3.0, and as such applications either run on blockchains, decentralized \\nnetwo rks of many  peer to peer nodes (servers), or a combination of the two that \\nforms a cryptoeconomic protocol . These are often referred to as dApps. 32North A merica Equity Research\\n10 January 2022Kenneth B.

Our understanding is that NFTs \\ntransformed Art Basil in Miami this past December.  But the utilization of NFTs \\nseems likely at its early stages and we see financial services as holding great \\npotential for tokenization broadly.  Some use cases f or NFTs areas follows. \\n33North A merica Equity Research\\n10 January 2022Kenneth B.

Morgan\\nGaming –The development of games take a bit longer than art or music, and we \\nexpect gaming will use NFTs in a much bigger way.  Concepts like play -to-earn are \\ndeveloping with NFTs as the assets in the games. Given the interoperability of \\nEthereum based tokens, we would expect ERC -721 to be the more likely standard \\nutilized in the early development of these game s.\\nNFTs as Tickets –NFTs can be the ticket to a concert, the memento, and the key to \\nunlocking backstage access all in one, but also automatically takes the ticket \\nproceeds and divides them between the artist, the crew, the venue. While the ticket \\ncan be made exclusive to cut out the scalpers, tickets that can be resold can \\nautomatically allocate any increase in ticket price on resale to the artist, crew and \\nvenue so that the content creators benefit from the upside.  I’m sure there will be \\nmore interestin g applications over time. \\nNFTs in the Metaverse –The metaverse canbe a place to store and appreciate NFT \\nart, it’s a hub for gaming, it’s a virtual reality world.  Like gaming, NFTs are \\npositioned to be the assets in the metaverse, with Ethereum as its currency. \\nTokenization of Ever ything. –Tokenization would seem to hold great potential for \\nfinancial services, in particular for illiquid assets that could benefit from price \\ndiscover y, liquidity , asset servicing, and asset composition. Settlement times for \\nequities at T+2 and for credit settlement is T+10+ , with som e products as long as \\nT+40 would benefit from tokenization. While transaction speeds are too slow for the \\nliquid products, there is the advantage of 24/7/365 trading, in addition to the risk \\nmitigation (and capital relief) that comes with near instant settlement. In our future \\nwe see the tokenization (and fractionalization) of credit, equities, parts of real estate \\n(commercial to residential to hotel rooms), and non -traded investments including\\nprivate equity.\\nDeFi –The Value of Crypto in Decentralized Finance\\nDecentralized Finance appears as a large opportunity for cryptomarkets to both \\nparticipate in and in some cases to disintermediate traditional finance. DeFi is \\nattempting to replicate ma ny or most of the products and services offered by banks, \\nincluding borrowing, lending, buying insurance, trading derivatives, buying assets, \\n34North A merica Equity Research\\n10 January 2022Kenneth B. W orthington, CFA\\n(1-212) 622 -6613\\nkenneth.b.worthington@jpmorgan.com\\n     \\n          \\nand earning interest. The existing financial system in the US has functioned for more \\nthan a century and operates under a regulatory framework that has been in place \\nsince the 1930s and 1940s.  DeFi is offering many of the same products and services \\nas traditio nal financial services firm s, but offers them in an updated framework, with \\nthe opportunity to operate faster and more efficiently in crypto’s peer -to-peer \\nnetwork rather than through system of independent companies and entities.  While \\nDeFi inherits many of Ethereum’s problems such as speed and cost, we see these \\nproblems as solvable and thus see DeFi as present ing a possibly more efficient \\nframework to offer financial services in the future. \\nFigure 24: Traditional Finance and its Decentralized Finance Challenger\\nSource: Consensys .\\nTrad Finance Has Excesses\\nOur traditional financial system today has more intermediaries than it probably \\nneeds.  Compare a trade in traditional finance to one for cryptocurrencies. In \\ntraditional finance, parties involved in a trade include the mobile app, the broker, the \\nmarket m aker, the exchange, the prime broker, the clearing house, custodian and \\ntransfer agent for the buyer and those same financial participants for the seller.  In the \\ncryptoecosystem when transacting with a token, there is the buyer, the intermediary \\nand the s eller.  In the cryptoecosystem, out of necessity and/or by design, the \\nintermediaries are vertically integrated. \\nExamples of DeFi today\\nThere are a number of examples where DeFi is permeating financial services. \\n\\uf0b7Lending : Lend out your crypto and ea rn int erest and rewards ever y minute –not \\nonce per month. Lending is based on the c ollateralization of crypto assets by \\nlocking them in smart contracts and borrowing against that collateral . Interest \\npayments, maturity  and lifecycle processes are all automated through the \\nprotocol .  It is estimated that $52bn is the value currently locked in lending \\nprotocols such as AAVE and Compound. \\n\\uf0b7Getting a loan: Obtain a loan instantly without filling in paperwork, including \\nextremely  short -term “flash loans” that traditional financial institutions don’t \\noffer.\\n35North A merica Equity Research\\n10 January 2022Kenneth B. W orthington, CFA\\n(1-212) 622 -6613\\nkenneth.b.worthington@jpmorgan.com\\n     \\n          \\n\\uf0b7Making a Payment: Decentralized payment tools designed to facilitate invoicing \\nand pay ments between merchants and customers. Here, d igital -native assets \\nstand out from legacy digital payment methods, such as those run by Visa and \\nPayPal, in that they remove all middlemen from transactions. When you pay \\nwith a credit card for coffee at a cafe, a financial institution sits between you and \\nthe business, with control over the transaction, retaining the authority t o stop or \\npause it and record it in its private ledger. By paying in cryptocurrencies, those \\ninstitutions could be cut out of the picture.  There is ~$3bn of value locked in \\ndecentralized payments in protocols such as Salier. \\nStablecoins : Another form of DeFi is the stablecoin. Cryptocurrencies often \\nexperience sharper price fluctuations than fiat. Stablecoi ns peg cryptocurrencies to \\nnon-cryptocurrencies, such as the US dollar, in order to keep the price under control. \\nWith the ability to send crypto like money, cyptocurrencies could alter the remittance \\nmarkets , B2B payments and cross -border money transfers.  While some see the \\ninterchange -fees charged by credit card companies as being at risk, this is not \\nconsidered the base case for the J.P. Morgan payme nts team. An example of DeFi in \\nstablecoins is Maker, a platform that collateralizes assets to create a stablecoin. \\nTrading : Non -custodial automated market making protocols running a decentralized \\norderbook.  Here, order matching and price -setting can be done completely \\nalgorithmically, allowing peer -to-peer trades of certain crypto assets without any \\nkind of brokerage.  There is ~$31bn locked in Decentralized Exchanges such as \\nUniswap. \\nSaving for the future : Put some of your crypto into savings account a lternatives and \\nearn better interest rates than you’d typically get from a bank.\\nBuying derivatives : Tokenized derivatives created without the need for a third party.  \\nCounterparty agreements are programmatically encoded, reducing the risk for \\nmalicious a ctivity.   Make long or short bets on certain assets. Think of these as the \\ncrypto version of stock options or futures contracts. There is an estimated $4.1bn \\nlocked in DeFi derivative protocols such as Synthetix. 36North A merica Equity Research\\n10 January 2022Kenneth B.

DeFi is distinct because it \\nexpands the use of blockchain from simple value transfer to more complex \\nfinancial use cases. Cutting out middlemen from all kinds of transactions is one \\nof the primary  advantages of decentralized finance.\\n\\uf0b7Open: You don’t need to apply for anything or “open” an account. You just get \\naccess by creating a wallet.\\n\\uf0b7Pseudonon ymous: You don’t need to provide your name, email address, or any \\npersonal information.\\n\\uf0b7Flexible: You can move your assets anywhere at any time, without asking for \\npermission, waiting for long transfers to finish, and paying expensive fees\\n\\uf0b7Fast: Interest Rates and rewards often update rapidly (as quickly as every 15 \\nseconds), and can be signific antly  higher than traditional Wall Street.\\n\\uf0b7Transparent: Everyone involved can see the full set of transactions (private \\ncorporations rarely grant that kind of transparency) .\\n37North A merica Equity Research\\n10 January 2022Kenneth B.

As mentioned above, the \\ndownside is network congestion and the impact that has on increasing gas costs and \\ntransaction expenses.  As such, DeFi that results in active transactions ca n be very \\nexpensive.  Other issues such as token volatility, the need to monitor transactions for \\ntax purposes and varying regulation from one region to another are also highlighted \\nas risks to DeFi. \\nTraditional Financial Services Companies Start to Embra ce Cryptocurrency \\nTechnology.\\n\\uf0b7Traditional Financial Services firms are servicing clients that want to engage in \\nthe cry ptoecosystem.  There are also examples where financial firms are \\nembracing the cryptoecosystem to make traditional financial offerings be tter.  \\nHere, we see traditional financial services on the front -end, but DeFi powering \\nthe back -end.  However, we see the current regulatory environment (really the \\nlack of Federal Crypto Rules and Regulation) limiting the presence that \\ntraditional finance can have in crypto.

The Ether eum merge is expected mid-2022 ,which \\nwill drive much greater energy efficiently, and we expect will position the \\n‘chain -of-chains’ fora significant boost to capacity, transaction speed and \\nusability as we enter 2023.  If 2021 was the year of the NFT, we see 2022 \\nas possibly the year of the blockchain bridge (driving greater \\ninteroperability of various chains) or the year of financial tokenization. As \\nsuch, we see the cryptocurrency markets as increasingly relevant to \\nfinancial services. \\n\\uf0b7Bitcoin –Stage -1.Bitcoin leverages blockchain technology to create \\ndecentralized ownership of digital assets, leveraging the transparency of \\na digital l edger. (We continue to see this innovation as amazing.) Bitcoin \\nas a digital currency has value in that it is highly efficient to own and \\ntransact –anywhere in the world in 30 minutes or less. But its nature as a \\ndigital asset contains a number of attribu tes that makes Bitcoin valuable \\nas digital scarcity and as a better store of value often referred to a digital \\ngold. \\n\\uf0b7Ethereum –Stage -2.Ether eum is the evolution of cryptocurrencies to a \\nprogrammable blockchain, a network that performs computations. This \\nmakes Ether eum smart and turns the blockchain into a global computing \\nengine, secured and transparent. This is wher e the fun really begins \\nbecause this programmability allows the development of smart contracts, \\nwhich drives the creation of decentralized app s dApps and more . \\n\\uf0b7The Implications .The applications from crypto have only just begun. \\nWeb3.0, greater use of NFTs and tokenization are in the line-of-sight for \\n2022. As financial analyst s, we are most excited about the implications \\nfor financial services and see the tokenization and fractionalization as \\nholding particularly large prom ise as transactions speeds in crypto \\nbecome more competitive with trad-fi networks. DeFi was a bit of a flop \\nin 2021, but still has strong potential in 2022 and beyond. \\n\\uf0b7Coin base Is Still a Buy. This prim er indicates to us that the use cases for \\nthe cryptomarkets will continue to grow and new projects andtokens \\nwith more and different use cases will surface. With these projects \\nattached to tokens and Coinbase a leading exchange to buy and sell\\ntokens, we see Coinbase as a leading direct beneficiary of cryptomarket \\ngrowth. 2North A merica Equity Research\\n10 January 2022Kenneth B.

Regulators have also stepped up their engagement in 2H21, but we \\nthink the market will need more from Federal US regulators to maintain the \\ninnovation momentum. \\nFor investors who want to greater insights into the cryptomarkets and some of its \\ninner workings, we offer a 101 -primer with both a discussion on how the \\ncryptomarkets work, as well as the state of the cryptocurrency markets as we see \\nthem today.  We expect the evolution of the cryptomarkets could accelerate in 2022, \\nparticularly for financial services should the promise of greater capacity and \\ntransaction speeds be delivered by upgrades to layer -1 chain Ethereum and/or new \\nlayer-2 initiatives.  \\nOur takeaway continues to be that taking the time to better understand the \\ncryptoecosystem is worth the effort. We see the likelihood that the cryptoecosyst em \\nwill be much bigger at the end of the year than it is today, and will have permeated \\nfar more of traditional finance three years from now than it has currently.  As such \\nwe see both the likelihood of more winning business models and investment \\nopportuni ties, as well as businesses that have the potential to become \\ndisintermediated.  The leading caveat to our bullish outlook remains regulation and \\nour concern that bending the existing regulatory framework to adapt to the \\ncryptoecosystem could constrain the innovation needed to better develop the \\ncryptocurrency  markets here in the US. However, we see politicians as having a far \\nbetter understanding of the cryptomarkets at year -end 2021 than they did at the \\nbeginning, an understanding thatwe think is a key i ngredient to better regulation.   \\nEvolution of the CryptoEcosystem\\nFigure 1: Timeline of Key CryptoEcosystem Milestone sin Recent Years\\nSource: Onyx by JPMorgan\\nThe cry ptoecosystem is still early in its development, being only fourteen years since \\nSatoshi Nakamoto wrote his/her/their whitepaper that jumpstarted the development \\nof Bitcoin and whi ch ultimately gave way to other developments such as Ethereum, \\nsmart contracts, tokenization, NFTs, Web3.0 and the Metaverse.  \\n4North A merica Equity Research\\n10 January 2022Kenneth B. W orthington, CFA\\n(1-212) 622 -6613\\nkenneth.b.worthington@jpmorgan.com\\n     \\n          \\nFor thos e that are beginning their journey into the cryptoecosystem, there are some \\nconcepts that helped usbetter understand the value of cr yptocurrencies, which helped \\nusset a base off of which to more fully explore the cryptomarkets. \\n1)Cryptocurrencies are tech nology . While investors trade tokens like assets, \\ncryptomarkets are te chnology and the underlying use cases are a big driver \\nof their value.  This technology is also the basis for communities that \\ndevelop around cryptocurrency projects, but in our view the technology \\ncomes first and is more important to the initial value creation. \\n2)The tokens are linked to blockchains. Investors with whom we have spoken \\nare far more willing to ascribe value to blockchains than they are to \\ncryptocurrencies.  There is a more easily  accepted belief that blockchain \\ntechnology has value, w hile the digital tokens are a retail driven pyramid \\nscheme.  However, the tokens and the blockchains are linked.  \\nDecentralized blockchains need a token with value to incentivize the\\nvalidation of the blockchain ― there needs to be a token and that token \\nneeds to have value in both proof -of-stake and proof -of-work.  While this \\ntoken value will fluctuate with supply and demand and thus the tokens can \\nget overvalued, a token with value is nonethele ss a necessary component of \\na decentralized blockchain. \\n3)Token value is based on the use cases for the blockchain. The value of the \\ntoken is set by the market, based on supply and demand.  Transactions on a \\nblockchain are paid in the native token and thus one needs to purchase the \\nunderlying token to transact.  For example, ERC -721 tokens (also referred \\nto as NFTs) are bought and sold with Eth (Ether) and gas prices (transaction \\nfees) are also paid in Eth. Acquiring Eth to transact in Ethereum based \\nproject s drives up the value of the Ether token. \\nThe Evolution of the CryptoEcosystem\\nWe see the development of the cryptoecosystem happening in three stages: 1) \\nBitcoin, 2) Ethereum and Smart Contracts, and 3) Tokens and the Metaverse.  Each \\ndevelopmental stage builds on the prior and with each stage there are more \\nopportunities to create new engagement and more fulsome communities, and thus \\ndevelop incremental business and revenue opportunities that didn’t exist in the past. \\nWhile we expect disintermediation, w e see the cryptomarkets more about creating \\nnew opportunities for engagement and thus more new business opportunities.  (NFTs \\nin Art Basil Miami brought out new artists and new buyers, complementing rather \\nthan disintermediating the traditional art world, for example.)\\nWe view Bitcoin as being mature in its value proposition, although adoption could \\nstill grow quite materially.  Ethereum / Smart Contract devel opment and adoption \\nalso appear to us to be quite early and depending on the impact of the merge on\\ncapacity  and transaction costs could propel the protocol to permeate gaming, \\nfinancial services, real estate and other businesses and asset classes.  We see \\ntokenization (non -fungible tokens) and the Metaverse still a t their infancy.  While \\nNFTs have represented an evolution in the art world and seem poised to infiltrate and \\nalter the gaming industry, we see NFT s and tokenization in their infancy.  We still \\nsee Web3.0 and the Metaverse as ‘ in-development.’ \\nWith this in mind, we walk through the evolution of the cryptoecosystem in more of \\na chronological order as we see each stage building on the prior.  While many new to 5North A merica Equity Research\\n10 January 2022Kenneth B.

It operates a permissionless \\nand decentralized ledger on which all Bitcoin transactions are recorded. Anyone can \\njoin and interact with the Bitcoin blockchain , and Bitcoin users can send ‘value’ from \\none account or wallet to another in matter of minutes, without the involvement of a \\nbank or financial institution. Think about transactions as emailing value to anyone or \\nanyentity  anywhere in the world, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year. \\nInherent in the bitcoin software is a hard limit cap of 21 million coins. There will \\nnever be more than that in existence and based on the current pace of mining, it will \\ntake u ntil 2140 for all the bitcoin to make it into circulation. \\nThe History of Bitcoin Starts with a White Paper with an \\nUnknown Author\\nBitcoin was created following the release of a white paper by Satoshi Nakamoto\\nwhich created an incentive structure that le d to the creation of Bi tcoin . The digital \\ncurrency  was intended to provide an alternative payment system that would operate \\nfree of central control but otherwise be used just like traditional currenc ies.From \\nhere, it has grown to be a well -recognized store of value ,with a market capitalization \\nof $871bn (as of Jan -4).  \\nFigure 2: Market Capitalization of Bitcoin Surges in 2020/2021\\n$ billion\\nSource: Bloomberg Finance L .P.and  J .P.

Transactions are verified by a network of nodes \\n(computers) through cryptography, with transaction details recorded in a public \\ndistributed ledger, the blockchain. The blockchain is a linked body of data, made up \\nof units called blocks that contain information about each and ever y transaction, \\nincluding date, time, total value, buyer and seller, and a unique identifying code for $bn$200bn$400bn$600bn$800bn$1000bn$1200bn$1400bnBitcoin Market Cap6North A merica Equity Research\\n10 January 2022Kenneth B.

It is the digital ledger of th e transaction history that \\nenables digital ownership, which we see as the genius of the cryptomarkets. Blocks \\nare created approximately every 10 minutes and contain approximately 500 \\ntransactions per block.  Bitc oin operates at ~7 TPS (transactions per sec ond), very \\nslow in terms of financial services.  The official Bitcoin software is maintained as an \\nopen -source project by Gavin Andresen , the lead Bitcoin developer at the Bitcoin \\nFoundation ,although neither has formal authority over the Bitcoin network.\\nFigure 3: Digital Representation of the Blockchain \\nSource: J.P.

By seeing the steps involved in such a \\ntransfer, we think it helps in better understanding the cryptoecosystem. \\nUnderstanding Pu blic and Private Keys –The Keys to Cryptography\\nThe transfer of bitcoin from one person to another utilizes p ublic and private keys, \\nintegral parts of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. These keys work in combination \\nto allow participants to send and rec eive cr yptocurrency without requiring a third \\nparty  like a bank to verify the transactions. The public and private keys fit together as \\na key  pair, and while o ne may  share the public key in order to receive transactions, \\nthe private key enables ownership. If anyone gains access to the private key, they \\nwill also have access to any cryptocurrency associated with those keys.\\n7North A merica Equity Research\\n10 January 2022Kenneth B. W orthington, CFA\\n(1-212) 622 -6613\\nkenneth.b.worthington@jpmorgan.com\\n     \\n          \\nFigure 4: Bitcoin Transaction Simulated\\nSource: The Times of India and J.P. Morgan .\\nA transaction that transfers bitcoin from wallet -1 from person -1 to another person -2 \\nin wallet -2 works something like this:\\n1.Person -1 wants to send one bitcoin to person -2. \\n2.Person -1 opens his/her wallet -1 and scans person -2’s wallet -2 to obtain the \\nwallet -2 public key, which is a series of letters and numbers that a user must \\nshare in order to receive funds. \\n3.Wallet -1 provides the private key to wallet -2, as well as the amount of Bitcoin \\nthat is going to be transferred, i n this case one bitcoin.  In addition, the sender \\nPerso n-1 will also include a mining fee that is measured in Satoris/vbyte, with \\nthe average transaction 250bytes and thus the typical fee $76 or ~15bps. \\n4.The wallet will communicate the transaction details to a node, which is any \\ncomputer (a simple PC/laptop) t hat sto res the entire bitcoin blockchain.  As of \\nthe writing of this note, there are ~12,000 bitcoin nodes that are all \\ninterconnected, and communicate with all the other nodes in the network and \\nvalidate the transaction. \\n5.Nodes will hold the verified Bitc oin transactions in a mempool (waiting area for \\nbitcoin transactions). Here, miners that have solved the complex cryptographic \\nhash puzzle (discussed in more detail later in the note) will pick up the validated \\nbitcoin transactions. Because a mempool might store 3mbs of transaction data \\nand because each bitcoin block only holds 1mb of data , the miner will s ort the \\ntransaction in the mempool typically  by the mining fee, and will add these \\nhigher fee transactions to the block and will collect both the mining fee and the \\nmining reward (6.25 bitcoin). Once the transaction is reported to the b lock, the \\ntransaction is complete. \\nAs seen in the process above, a higher transaction fee will lead to faster execution \\nsince itis more profitable for the miner.  If the m ining fee is below average, the \\ntransaction could be sorted to the bottom of the mempool and may wait unconfirmed \\n8North A merica Equity Research\\n10 January 2022Kenneth B.

Until the transaction makes it to the \\nblockchain, it is not complete. \\nPrivate keys are the foundati on of security for cryptocurrency transactions. Private \\nkeys are generated by pseudorandom number generators (PRNGs) to generate \\nthese random positive integers. Private keys for Bitcoin and Ethereum are 78 digits \\nlong with the set of numbers from which a k ey is selected so massive in size, roughly \\nthe same size as the number of visible atoms in the universe, the probabilities of \\ngenerating two of the same private keys is negligible. As of today, there have been \\nno known hacks that have allowed someone to si gn transactions without knowing the \\nprivate key. \\nThe Process of Mining and Proof of Work\\nThe bitcoin blockchain is validated via the proof -of-work protocol, a consensus \\nmechanism used to confirm that netwo rk participants (called miners) calculate valid \\nalphanumeric codes (called hashes), verify Bitcoin transactions and include them in \\nthe next block added to the blo ckchain. \\nMiners Represent the Security Mechanism for Bitcoin\\nMining was introduced as the solution to the double -spend problem. If I have 1 \\nBitcoin and I send it to someone , and then try sending that same Bitcoin to another \\nperson , the network ensures that only one transaction will be accepted. It does this \\nthrough mining. Oneof the key features of Bitcoin is itsdecentralization , operating a \\ndigital ledger securely without the involvement of a bank, government or other \\ncentral authority. But the distributed network needs a mechanism to act as the final \\narbiter, to ensure that nobody manipulates the blockchain for their own purpos e(such \\nas to double spend existing bitcoin as above ). Mining is this decentralized security \\nsystem. \\nThe Digital Ledger Allows for the Ownership of a Digital Asset\\nTo operate a decentralized digital ledger that can be trusted is a challenge, and the \\nblock chain is the best decentralized mechanism yet created and widely accepted to \\nown a digital asset.  Because digital assets can be copied exactly, the \\ndatabase/accounting ledger recorded on the blockchain for all to see and verify \\nallows one to show the tran saction history of the digital asset and ultimately to prove \\nownership. Ownership of a digital asset, an asset that can be exactly reproduced in \\ncode, is a true innovation of the blockchain and proof of work as a validation of this \\nblockchain is again an i ncredible innovation. \\nProof -of-Work –The Protocol that Validates the Blockchain\\nBitcoin uses the proof -of-work protocol to validate the blockchain, the process by \\nwhich the digital ledger is updated by adding new blocks with all the most recent \\ntransacti ons. This proof-of-work protocol is often described as solving a \\n“cryptographic puzzle. ”The underlying tech nology that powers this immutability \\nand security is cryptographic hashing. A cryptographic hash function is a \\nmathematical function that, simply pu t, takes any input and quickly maps it to a \\nfixed -size string output.  Crypt ographic hashin g is deterministic (any input will \\nalways generate the same output), fast, unique (each input with result in a random \\nand unique output such that no two inputs will ever result in the same output), and \\nirreversible (given the output of the hash function, one cannot determine the input ).\\nThe algorithm Bitcoin uses to generate the hash is called SHA -256, whichalways \\ngenerates hashes asa 256bit number, the equivalent of 64 characters.  SHA -256 is an 9North A merica Equity Research\\n10 January 2022Kenneth B. W orthington, CFA\\n(1-212) 622 -6613\\nkenneth.b.worthington@jpmorgan.com\\n     \\n          \\nadaptation of SHA -2,which was created by the NSA in 2001 .  Bitcoin\\'s proof -of-\\nwork algorithm then generates a hash for the block.  Think of a hash like a \\nfingerprint that identifi es a speci fic piece of data.\\nMining Explained\\nMining is the process duri ng which all transactions are broadcast to the network and \\nareusually confirmed within 10 -20 minutes.  Mining is a distributed consensus \\nsystem that is used to confirm pending transactions by including them in the \\nblockchain. It enforces a chronological order in the block chain, protects the \\nneutrality  of the network, and allows different computers to agree on the state of the \\nsystem. To be confirmed, transactions must be packed i n ablock thatfit very strict \\ncryptographic rules that will b e verified by the network. These rules prevent previous \\nblocks from being modified (altering the records of past transactions for example)\\nbecause doing so would easily  and visibly invalidate all the subseque nt blocks. \\nMining also creates the equivalent of a competitive lottery that prevents certain \\nminers from repeatedly /consecutively adding new blocks to the block chain. In this \\nway, no group or individuals can control what is included in the block chain or \\nreplace parts of the block chain to their advantage .\\nMiners and Rewards\\nThe process of Bitcoin mining involves specially designed computers that aggregate \\nBitcoin transactions into a block to add to the blockchain.  In exchange, the miners 1) \\ncollect trans actio n fees and 2) are paid a reward in the form of Bitcoin by the \\nnetwork.  The process starts with Bitcoin miners selecting one megabyte worth of \\ntransactions, bundling them as an input into the SHA -256 function, and attempting to \\nfind a specific output (solving the cryptographic puzzle) the network accepts. This \\npuzzle is complex and requires significant computational resources to solve.  \\nHowever once solved, the puzzle is both easy to verify as the right solution by the \\nbroader network, while also simul taneously validating all current and past \\ntransactions in the blockchain.  Think of mining as solving a complex 10,000 picture \\npuzzle on the dinner table –it is challenging to put together but once completed it is \\neasy to verify  that all the pieces have b een put together properly.  The first miner to \\nsolve the cryptographic puzzle and find this output will publish the block to the \\nnetwork and w illreceive a reward in the form of transaction fees and the creation of \\n6.25 new Bitcoin, currently valued at ~$3 25,000.  A new Bitcoin block is added \\nevery 10 minutes, which makes the business of mining a big business. We note that \\nroughly ever y four y ears, the software running on the blockchain makes it half as \\nprofitable to mine bitcoin as it r educesthe size of the block rewards.\\nThe Cryptographic Puzzle –Hash This Hash That\\nA bitcoin block contains a header and a record of all of the new transactions, \\nincluding buyer, seller, time and date of the transactions. Each block has a unique \\nheader that is comprised of s ix pieces of information: 1) client software version, 2) \\ntimestamp of the block, 3) root o f the containing transactions’ M erkle tree, 4) hash of \\nthe prio r block, 5) a nonce and 6) the target. \\nFirst –let’s start with how a Merkle tree cha rt works.  10North A merica Equity Research\\n10 January 2022Kenneth B.

Morgan .\\nThe M erkle root (at the top of Figure 5) acts as the effective summary of all of the \\ntransactions in the block.  A Merkletree is simple concept where transaction leaves\\nare hashed together using SHA -256 into parents, and parents are hashed together \\nwith those outputs again hashed until a single Merkle root,which becomes the \\nunchangeable summary of all of the transactions in the block. If one of the \\ntransactions in the b lock were changed at a later date, the output in the Merkleroot \\nwould change all the way up the tree and would be easily recognized by any \\ncomputer node looking at the root (the top hash in the graphic below.)\\nFigure 6: When a Le af in the Merkle Tree Changes, the Parent and Root Is Altered\\nSource: J.P. Morgan .\\nFinding the Correct Nonce that Leads to the Correct Block Hash\\nThe core of mining comes from the nonce and the target, which are the basis for the \\ncryptographic puzzle th at minors have to solve to create the new block. The miner is \\ntrying to find the number (the nonce) that when added to a combination of the known \\ninformation in the header including the hash of the previous block, the transaction \\nhash of the existing block , and the timestamp of the existing block can be hashed \\ntogether using SHA -256 to generate the correct 67 digit output (the correct hash \\nsignature) for the block to be included on the blockchain.  \\nhash (ABCD)Top Hash / Merkle Root\\nhash (C)Hash Parent\\nhash (D)Hash Parent\\nhash (CD)Hash Parent\\nCTransaction Leaves\\nDTransaction Leaves\\nhash (A)Hash Parent\\nhash (B)Hash Parent\\nhash (AB)Hash Parent\\nATransaction Leaves\\nBTransaction Leaves Data \\nBlocks\\nhash (ABCD)Top Hash / Merkle Root\\nhash (C)Hash Parent\\nhash (D)Hash Parent\\nhash (CD)Hash Parent\\nCTransaction Leaves\\nDTransaction Leaves\\nhash (A)Hash Parent\\nhash (B)Hash Parent\\nhash (AB)Hash Parent\\nATransaction Leaves\\nBTransaction Leaves Data \\nBlocks11North A merica Equity Research\\n10 January 2022Kenneth B.

Both the target and the output hash are incredibly large \\nnumbers. When converted to base -10, they  are 67 digits long.  So miners will hash \\nthe block header together with their guess at the nonce over and over un til they find a \\nnonce that works. For the first block, the genesis block in Bitcoin and the easiest of \\nthe cry ptographic puzzles, it took nearly 2.1bn computations to find a nonce that \\nresulted in a hash that was acceptable. It has gotten much harder since then. \\nBelow in Figure 8, we show how the block header from one block becomes a \\ncomponent of the block header for the next block .  Go back to the Merkle tree ― if \\nany old block is altered ,the entire chain is changed ,which can be easily recognized \\nby the community, which can revert back to the prior chain. \\nFigure 8: Visual Representation of the Bitcoin Blockchain and the Role of the Block Header \\nSource: J.P. Morgan.\\nOnce a miner finds a correct nonce, the calculated hash (signature) is added to the \\nblock’s header. The signature acts as a block lock, preventing further changes to the \\ntransactions stored inside the block. The ‘winning’ miner broadcasts the complete \\nblock to other nodes that verify that the nonce results in a correct hash signature. \\nOnce 50% of the nodes verify the block, a state of consensus is reached and the block \\nis considered valid and the entire network adds the block to the chain. \\nThe miner who co rrectly  publishes the block is rewarded with new bitcoin, currently \\n6.25 bitcoin. This takes place in the mining process, as miners areallowed to add an \\nadditional output transaction to the block that attributes 6.25bitcoin to themselves. \\nEvery four years , the reward for mining bitcoin will fall in half.  Sometime in early \\n2024, the reward will fall from 6.25bitcoin to 3.125 bitcoin.  Once all the bitcoin are \\nmined sometime in 2140, miners will work solely for the mining fee. \\nThe Bitcoin network protocol adjusts the algorithm’s difficulty every two weeks to \\nmaintain a 10 minute average block time.

On the contrary, if computational power declines (i.e., the \\nnetwork mining capacity declines), as what happened when China banned bitcoin \\nmining last year, the target is made easier .\\nThe Value of Bitcoin \\nNothing inherently valuable underpins the bitcoin network , similar to many  of the \\nworld’s fiatcurrencies since leaving thegold standard .  However, we do see value \\ndriven by  the Bitcoin technology that enables both the concept of digital scarcity and \\nultimately its merit as a store of value. Such digital scarcity has become more \\nvaluable since the o utbreak of Covid -19 that contributed to a significant increase in \\nglobal government debt and drove some to look for alternatives to fiat currencies as \\nglobal stores of value. \\nIn our opinion, Bitcoin is particul arly well designed as a modern store of value, and \\nthe strong design has contributed to the increased confidence in and value of Bitcoin. \\nWhile many are buying cryptocurrencies (chasing in our opinion) because the \\ncryptocurrencies are appreciating and/or a re meaningfully outperforming other asset \\nclasses, we think the merits of Bitcoin will endure near -term fluctuations in value, \\nboth in terms of digital scarcity as well as a good store of value.\\nDefining a Store of Value –Eight Characteristics \\nOur resear ch indicates that there are eight characteristics that define a good store of \\nvalue.  We see Bitcoin as being distinguished in six, but disadvantaged in two.  \\nRelative to gold, we see Bitcoin is at least or more durable, portable, fungible, \\nvisible, scarce , verifiable, and free from censorship. However, Bitcoin falls short of \\ngold in its history as a store of value and we add a ninth as a greater level of price \\nvolatility . \\n\\uf0b7Durable –Bitcoin cannot be destroyed nor does it perish.  It will survive as long \\nas the network survives, which given the network is decentralized makes bitcoin \\nvery hard to destroy. Wheat, soybeans, corn and other food items have failed in \\nhistory  as stores of value because they are perishable. When comparing gold to \\nbitcoin, both are durable.\\n\\uf0b7Portable –Bitcoin is particularly easy to store and transport. Large quantities of \\nBitcoin can be transmitted all over the world nearly instantly and can be stored \\non a cell phone.  Gold is far harder and more expensive to store, transport and \\ninsure.\\n\\uf0b7Fungible –Bitcoin is fungible and is interchangeable with all other Bitcoin. Gold \\nis generally fungible and can be readily seen as better than diamonds ,which can \\nhave different qualities and s hapes that impact value. That said, gold comes in \\ndiffer ent measures of purity with 24k gold and 14k gold of different values. The \\nedge goes to Bitcoin. \\n\\uf0b7Divisible –Bitcoin is divisible out to eight decimal places, out to 1/100,000,000, \\nwhich today is worth $0.0005. Gold is divisible, but not easily accurately . \\n\\uf0b7Scarce –Bitcoin has a finite number of tokens, capped at 21mn, which will be \\nmined by ~2140.  Gold is difficult to mine and there is expected to be a finite \\namount.  However, as the price of gold rises, so does the supply. 13North A merica Equity Research\\n10 January 2022Kenneth B. W orthington, CFA\\n(1-212) 622 -6613\\nkenneth.b.worthington@jpmorgan.com\\n     \\n          \\n\\uf0b7Verifiable –Bitcoin is read ily verifiable with transactions recorded on the \\nblockchain ,which is publicly available for all to view. Gold too is verifiable, but \\ncan also be forged and its purity can be diluted ,making value more questionable.  \\n\\uf0b7Free from censorship –A censorship re sistant asset cannot be stopped or \\nconfiscated by any authority, including governments. Users are uninhibited from \\nowning or transferring value at their discretion. No entity (including developers \\nor miners) has any undue influence on a users’ Bitcoin.  As such, Bitcoin is \\ncensorship resistant and because the protocol is decentralized, it is not subject to \\nthe demand or constraints of large corpor ations or governments. Government s \\ndo and have restricted both the ownership of gold and the transfer of gold \\nthroughout history. The Gold Reserve Act of 1934 prohibited the American \\npeople from owning gold, with the exception of jewelry and certain collector’s \\ncoins. \\nWe think Bitcoin falls short of other ‘stores -of-value’ in two ways.  First, Bitcoin has \\na limited histo ry as a store of value ,having only been created in 2009.  Gold has \\nbeen used as a store of value for a t least 5,000 years and more likely at least 7,000 \\nyears as that is w hen the first know gold mine was active. Bitcoin is also volatile, \\nwith price volatility levels materially higher than other asset classes including gold, \\nthe US$, equities and commodities. Because of the evaluated price volatility versus \\nother asset classes, Bitcoin would likely not make a good currency as hi gher \\nvolatility  could u ndermine crypto as a medium of exchange, as a unit of account and \\nas a standard for deferred payments, the other recognized functions of money.  But \\neven concerns over higher volatility have been met with Bitcoin support because \\nBitcoin has been an appreci ating asset, volatile for sure, but with significant value \\nappreciation. \\nFigure 9: Bitcoin Much More Volatile than Traditional Asset Classes \\nSource: J.P.

Morgan estimates.\\nThe Transition to Ethereum\\nWhile the technology backing bitcoin is significant, we see the use cases for Bitcoin \\nas rather one-dimensional.  Bitcoin represents digital scarcity and therefore digital \\nvalue.  But cryptocurrencies made a leap beyond digital value with the development \\nof Ethereum.  If Bitcoin is digital value, Ethereum is a digital canvas or software \\nplatform that allows developers to create new crypto and traditional applications. Its \\nuse cas es are far more significant than what we see for Bitcoin.\\nEthereum and Smart Contracts –Stage 2 \\n–dApps T ake Form\\nEthereum was launched in 2014 and it has become a further evolution in \\nthedesign of and thinking about cryptocurrency networks. It is a more funct ional and \\ngeneral computation protocol that draws upon concepts from Bitcoin to \\ncreate application -based blockchain transactions, meaning it provides more functions \\nthan just account -based sending and receiving. It utilizes blockchain technology  not \\nonly for maintaining a decentralized pay ment network but also for storing computer \\ncode that can be used to power tamper -proof decentralized financial contracts and \\napplicati ons.  So while Bitcoin is characterized as a virtual decentralized currency  \\nbest recognized as a store of value, Ethereum is a decentralized software platform \\noff of which developers leverage smart contracts to develop decentralized \\napplications and fungible/non -fungible tokens. \\nHistory of Ethereum –Building on the Base Created by \\nBitcoin\\nEthereum was created by Vitalik Buterin in 2014. (Here is a link to his w hite \\npaper Ethereum white paper published in 2013.)  Ethereum is the blockchain and \\nEther (Eth) is the token, although most refer to Ether as Eth. Vitalik became \\ninterested in Bitcoin in 2011, co -founded Bitcoin Magazine in September of that year \\nand remained immersed in all topics Bitcoin for two years. He wrote his Ethereum \\nwhite paper in Nov 2013 to build Ethereum as a blockchain based platform that could \\nbe programm ed for many more applications than what Bitcoin could do as a peer -to-\\npeer currency.

Morgan. (1/3/21)\\nThe Workings of Ethereum\\nWhile Bitcoin is positioned as a digital currency based on scarcity value, Ethereum is \\nprogrammable blockchain that is the base of many other fungible and non -fungible \\ntokens. It is often referred to as the ‘chai n-of-chains’ because it is the base -chain or \\nbuilding block for other tokens. Like other cryptocurrencies, Ethereum works on a \\nblockchain network and is therefore a decentralized, distributed public ledger on \\nwhich transactions are recorded and verified. L ike Bitcoin, Ethereum utilizes the \\nproof -of-work protocol to validate its blockchain. But there are some key differences \\nbetween Bitcoin and Ethereum. Ether block time is faster (Ether transactions are \\nconfirmed in seconds while Bitcoin transactions take m inutes). Ether uses a different \\nprocessing algorithm with Bitcoin transactions run off the SHA -256 and Ethereum \\nEtash. While Ethereum currently runs on proof -of-work, it will convert to proof -of-\\nstake mid -2022, a change that we expect could alter the crypt ocurrency  landscape, as \\nwe discuss further below.\\nA most significant difference between Bitcoin and Ethereum is that Ethereum is \\nprogrammable and the Ethereum network can perform computations. It is this \\ncomputatio nal capability that turns what is a store of value and medium of exchange \\nfor Bitcoin into a global computing engine and openly verifiable data store in \\nEthereum. Ethereum as a programmable network allows for self -executing contracts \\n(smart contracts) with agreements programmed right into the Ethe reum blockchain.\\nEthereum operates under and benefits from three characteristics:\\n\\uf0b7Large Decentralized Network –Ethereum is the largest cryptocurrency \\necosystem and has a significant community committed to the protocol. As such \\nthere are significant number s of smart contracts that have already been written \\nand vetted by blockchain engineers in Solidity (Ethereum’s programming \\nlanguage) that can be integrated or expanded into new blockchain solutions. In \\naddition, Ethereum h as been tested with billions of do llars of transactio nsand \\nthus operates with significant credibility .This draws even more programmers \\nand users to the Ethereum network.   $bn$100bn$200bn$300bn$400bn$500bn$600bn$700bn$800bn$900bnMarket Cap of Top 20 Coins16North A merica Equity Research\\n10 January 2022Kenneth B.

Ethereum’s decentralized \\nnetwork promises to let users leave behind third -party intermediaries, like \\nlawy ers who write and interpret contracts, banks that are intermediaries in \\nfinancial transactions or third -party web hosting services.\\n\\uf0b7Upgrades of the Functionality ‒A large community of Ethereum developers is \\nlooking for ways to improve the network and develop new applications. \\nEthereum is an evolving blockchain. Recent upgrade s(discussed in a separate \\npiece of research on the London Hard Fork )introd uced the ability to burn tokens \\nand limit Ethereum mining driv en inflation, for example .  However, the most \\nradical change is expected mid-2022 when Ethereum is expected to migrate from \\nProof -of-Work to Proof -of-Stake . \\nEthereum –the Chain of Chains Drives New Applications \\nBecause Ethereum is programmable, there ar e significant applications that have been \\ndeveloped using the Ethereum technology.  This begins with sm art contracts through \\nto dApps and fungible/non -fungible tokens.  We see five general uses for Ethereum.\\n\\uf0b7Currency: Similar to Bitcoin, you can send and receive Eth or pay for goods \\nand services. As such, Eth (Ether) can be a store of value. \\n\\uf0b7Smart contracts: Ethereum allows for the development of smart contracts, \\npermissionless applications that automatically execute when the contract’s \\nconditio ns have been met.  It is these smart -contracts that are the basis for the \\nother applications described below.  \\n\\uf0b7Digital apps, or dApps :Ethereum powers digital apps that allow users to play \\ngames, invest, send money, track an i nvestment portfolio, follow social media \\nand more. Currently, over 440,000 ERC -20 tokens have been developed on \\nEthereum. \\n\\uf0b7Non-fungible tokens :The majority of NFTs are p owered by Ethereum and can \\nallow artists or others to sell art or other items directly to buyers using smart \\ncontracts. NFTs are ERC -721, non -fungible tokens. The bonus here is that one \\ncan build a royalty structure right into the blockchain, empowering th e content \\ncreator.\\n\\uf0b7Decentralized finance: By using Ethereum, some people may be able to avoid \\ncentralized (government, bank) control ove r the movement of money or other \\nassets. DeFi is trying to put the central functions of financial services companies \\non the blockchain, essentially cutting out the bank/broker/exchange as the \\nfinancial intermediary with the promise of greater speed, lower cost and greater \\nsecurity . \\nSmart Contracts on Ethereum \\nSmart contracts are the base on which dApps , NFTs and DeFi are created. A smart \\ncontract refers to a piece of computer program that gets executed by a quorum of \\nblockchain nodes and often facilitate the exchange of money, share or property. At \\ntheir core, smart contracts are executable programs used to automate the ex ecution of \\nan agreement on the blockchain without the need for intermediaries. 17North A merica Equity Research\\n10 January 2022Kenneth B. W orthington, CFA\\n(1-212) 622 -6613\\nkenneth.b.worthington@jpmorgan.com\\n     \\n          \\nSmart contracts are essentially automated agr eements, written in code and baked into \\nthe blockchain, making them immutable as well as irreversible. They contain terms \\nand condi tions of a mutually agreed contract and can define rules like a regular \\ncontrac t, but that is automatically enforced via the code. Smart contracts are not \\nlegally  binding the way traditional contracts are. Yet, smart contracts are powerful \\nbecause they can increase the speed, accuracy, and integrity in payment and \\nperformance transac tions.  Once executed, the smart contract cannot be altered. Yet \\nthe ability for Ethereum to support the development of smart contracts is key in the \\nfurther development of Decentralized Applications including fungible and non -\\nfungible tokens and ultimatel y decentralized finance , discussed further below. \\nIn Figure 12 below, we show that smart contracts are based on program functions, \\nwith inputs processed to create outputs. The logic inside smart contracts determine if \\na transaction is valid, with valid tr ansactions result ingin updated blockchain state, \\nwith invalid transactions rejected by the network from being included. The example \\nof an invalid transaction would be the spending of tokens without a sufficient \\nbalance. \\nFigure 12: Smart Contracts\\nSource: Kaleido.\\nFigure 13: Smart Contracts\\nSource: Ethereum.org and J.P.

The number of dApps \\nhasgotten big with more than 3600 dApps spanning different industries such as \\ngaming, financial services and social media. They are growing in relevan ceand are \\nestimated to be responsible for nearly $200 billion worth (and growing) of user \\ntransactions annually. \\ndApps are decentralized applications, similar to normal apps ,but run on peer -to-peer \\nnetworks like blockchains.  As such, dApps are open -sourc e and operate without one \\nentity  controlling its data , with records that are publicly available and use a \\ncryptographic token to keep the network secure.  dApps are built by combining a \\nuser interface front -end and smart contract back -end.  \\ndApp =Front-end+Smart Contract Back-end\\nIn dApps , the fro nt-end can be programmed in any language, but w ill call aback-end \\nwritten into the blockchain.  In terms of front -end user experience, dApps appear \\nnearly  identical to tradit ionalweb applications. However on the back -end, dApps\\nfunction much differently than their conventional counterparts. Instead of employing \\nthe HTTP protocol to communicate with the b roader network, dApps connect to the \\nblockchain in a decentralized manner rather than routing through cen tralized servers. \\nWe see the power of dApps is their decentralization, which makes them both free \\nfrom cens orship and easier to create. dApps are characterized by:\\n\\uf0b7Open source : The code is public for anyone to look at, copy and audit.\\n\\uf0b7Decentralization : dApps don’t have anyone in charge, so no central authority \\ncan stop users from doing what they want on the app.\\n\\uf0b7No Downtime: After deploying thesmart contract ontheblockchain, the\\nnetwork canalways serve theneeds ofclients whowant tointeract with the\\nsmart contract. Furthermore, dApps canalsoensure thatanymalicious actors\\ncannot launch denial -of-service attacks onspecific apps. Itwillcontinue to\\nfunction even ifparts ofthenetwork architecture arenon-functional.\\n\\uf0b7Censorship Free: Decentralized apps donotallow control ofthedata and\\nprocesses toasingle entity.Therefore, itisimpossible foranygovernment or\\nentity toblock users from submitting transactions ordeploying dApps, andeven\\nreading data from theblockchain. Without anyspecifi cindividual or\\norganizatio ncontrolling adApp ,users have theadvantage ofcomplete freedom\\nwith dApps.\\n\\uf0b7Private : You would find that a major share of decentralized applications does \\nnot demand the real identity of users. Rather than going through a complicated \\nand lengthy signup process, users could access dApps with their Ethereum login \\ncredentials and a digital wallet.\\n\\uf0b7Data Integrity: With the power of cryptography , decentralized applications \\nensure the secure storage of data on relevant blockchai n networks. Furthermore, \\nthe accessibility of public blockchain for verify ing transactions also provides the \\nassurance of reliability in data records.19North A merica Equity Research\\n10 January 2022Kenneth B.

Ethereum makes dApp \\ndevelopment easier by offering a development interface that reduces programming \\ntime and helps projects quickly launch. In addition, the Ethereum developer \\ncommunity has grown significant ly since the platform’s launch with a network that \\nshares code and ideas. Ethereum also retains formidable network effects from its \\nglobal coalition of technologists who remain committed to maintaining the network \\nand actively developing user resources tha t drive adoption. The ability to monetize \\nDApp projects incentivizes others to par take in the Ethereum ecosystem.\\nEthereum also uses a network -native language Solidity for coding smart contracts. \\nBut the network architecture eliminates the need to develop an entirely new \\nblockchain for ever y dApp. Once a smart contract is created, it is uploaded to the \\nEthereum Virtual Machine (EVM) ,which is a runtime compiler that executes the \\nsmart contract code. EVM is operated in what is called a ‘sandbox’ environment ,\\nwhich is isolated from the main n etwork to create an optimal testing environment. \\nOnce the code is on the EVM, everyone part of the Ethereum network has a copy of \\nthe contract. Once the smart contract is tested and verified ,it is uploaded to the \\nEthereum Mainnet.  \\nDevelopers can work with the ready -made Ethereum system to fast -track o nboarding \\nand get their applications up and running sooner than other alternatives. By \\ncombining application templates and the EVM, the overall Ethereum development \\nkit allo ws companies to focus on refining their applications and developing on top of \\nopen -source code among a global, mission -based developer community.\\ndApps and Tokenization\\nWe see tokenization as one of the major foundations of Ethereum. Tokenization is a \\nfeature used to define smart contracts and is acore element in dApps. But when we \\nrefer to tokens, there are two standards that have emerged on Ethereum ‒ERC -20 \\nand ERC -721. (The ERC stands for Ether eum Request for Comment, which i s the \\nsystem that allows for comments onthe standardization of Ethereum tokens and \\nfeatures a standard set of rules for creating tokens. ) As we reflect back, we see a \\nnumber of references to 2021 as the year of the NFT. To us, it is just the beginning of \\ntokenization. \\nERC -20 vs. E RC-721 Tokens\\nThere are two main token standards for Ethereum tokens.  At their most basic level, \\nERC -20 tokens are fungible tokens and are used for all smart contracts on the \\nEthereum blockchain.  Examples include BinanceCoin (BNB) ,the fourth largest \\ntoken by  market cap at $78bn, Stablecoins Tether and USDC ,which have a \\ncombined market cap of $ 121bn.  ERC -721 are non -fungible tokens (NFTs) ,which\\narea type of unique digital certificate, registered on a blockchain that can be used to \\nrecord ownership of any asset, best known for digital collectibles. While ERC -20 \\ntokens represent a single asset and are interchangeable, ERC -721 tokens are \\nindivisible and represent a collection of assets. Examples here including \\nCryptoKitti es, Etheremons, Crypto Bots, and B lockchain Cuties.20North A merica Equity Research\\n10 January 2022Kenneth B.

Morgan.\\nERC -20 –The Fungible Tokens\\nERC -20 was created by Fabian Vogelsteller in 2015 and is the standard for creating \\nfungible tokens that are comp atible with the broader Ethereum network. ERC -20 \\ntokens are built on the Ether eum blockchain and adhere to a set of standards that \\nallow the tokens to work with all other Ethereum smart contracts, enabling the \\nexchange of one ERC -20 token for another and allowing the easy i ntegration with \\nother smart c ontracts, wallets, or marketplace s. ERC -20 smart contracts use ERC -20 \\ntokens to make payments when their protocol calls for it. Any smart contract that \\ninvolves pa yments will therefore pay the user in the for m of an ERC -20 token. \\nMany  dApps built o n Ethereum have their own cryptocurrencies or “tokens.” As of \\nAugust, there were over 440,000 ERC -20 tokens on Ethereum’s main network across \\nmore than 900 projects.  ERC -20 tokens are typically sold via a variety o f different \\nofferings as a way to raise early -stage capital for the underlying project. Many of the \\nprojects raised money in the initial coin offering boom of 2017.\\n21North A merica Equity Research\\n10 January 2022Kenneth B.

Morgan.\\nIn order to interact with the dApps, users need to purchase the dApp’s native token. \\nOne purchases an Ethereum -based NFT using the ETH token, for example. Generally \\nspeaking, a token represents something specific in a given ecosystem. This could be \\neconomic value, a dividend, a stake, a voting right , really anything. It’s important to \\nunderstand that a token is not limited to one particular role; it can fulfill various \\ndifferent of roles in its native ecosystem.  That said, the most common u se for tokens \\nis to transact. T here are three types of blockchain -based tokens that we will discuss:\\n\\uf0b7Usage tokens: A token that is required to use a service. These are the tokens that \\nfunction like a currency in their respective dApps. This is generally th e most \\nsimple and straightforward application of a token. These tokens have monetary \\nvalue , but don’t come with any sort of rights or privilege within the particular \\nnetwork.\\n\\uf0b7Work tokens: A token that gives users the right to contribute work to a DAO \\nand e arn in exchange for their work. In this model, the user (or service provider) \\nstakes the native token of the network to earn the right to perform work for the \\nnetwork. Given a fixed supply of tokens, service providers will rationally pay \\nmore per token for the right to earn part of a growing cash flow stream. The \\nimportant thing to understand at this stage is that work tokens grant access to the \\nnetwork and provide cash flow potential conditional on the deliver y of work \\nwith the token .\\n\\uf0b7Security tokens: An external, tradable asset that is a representation of value in a \\nsystem. Security  tokens, also known as tokenized securities or investment \\ntokens, are financial securities compliant with SEC regulations. What makes \\nsecurity tokens so neat (and potentially re volutionary) is that the rights are \\nwritten into a smart contract and the tokens are traded o n a blockchain -powered \\nexchange –24/7/365 with near instant settlement.\\n22North A merica Equity Research\\n10 January 2022Kenneth B.

In return, investors receive newly minted tokens \\nprior to the official launch at wholesale prices.\\n\\uf0b7Voting rights: Tokens can be used for voting on project decisions. In this \\ninstance, the more tokens users have ,the more influence they have over each \\nelection.\\n\\uf0b7Represent physical objects: Atoken can represent ownership of assets, such as \\ngold.\\n\\uf0b7New features: Sometimes builders need a token for paying for the functionality \\nof their projects, but the native token on Ethereum, Eth, is not enough for them. \\nSo, they  create a new token with the fu nctionality they need.\\nERC -721 T okens --NFTs\\nThe ERC -721 Token standard enables Non -Fungible Tokens (NFTs) on the Ethereum \\nblockchain. J ust like the ERC -20 token standard helps in creating fungible tokens, the \\nERC -721 focuses on non -fungible asset s. ERC -721 tokens help bring the concept of \\nuniqueness to the blockchain, ensuring that distinctive details about an asset can be \\nimmortalized. NFTs can be used to provide digital representation of a one -of-a-kind \\nartwork, with ownership that is easily proved thro ugh blockchain records and can \\nlimit things like counterfeiting.\\nThe Ethereum Foundation describes the workings of an NFT like this.  An NFT has \\none owner at a time, which is managed through the uniqueID and metadata that no \\nother token can replicate. NFTs are minted through smart contracts that assign \\nownership and manage the transferability. When an NFT is created, the creator \\nexecutes code stored in smart contracts that conform to a certain standard, such as \\nERC -721, and th is information is added to the blockchain where the NFT is being \\nmanaged. The minting process, from a high level, has the following ste ps that it goes \\nthrough:\\n\\uf0b7Creating a new block$bn$50bn$100bn$150bn$200bn$250bn$300bn$350bn$400bn$450bn$500bn\\n4Q18 2Q19 4Q19 2Q20 4Q20 2Q21 4Q21Market Cap of ETH vs  25 Largest ERC -20 Tokens\\nEthereum Top 2523North A merica Equity Research\\n10 January 2022Kenneth B.

While we discuss the implications later in \\nthe note, some key properties are as follows.  \\n1.Each NFT has a unique identifier that is directly linked to one Ethereum \\naddress.\\n2.NTFs are not directly interchangeable with other tokens 1:1. For example 1 \\nETH is exactly the same as another ETH. This isn\\'t the case with NFTs. \\n3.Each token has an owner and this information is easily verifiable.  Here, the \\ntoken proves that the copy of t he digital file is the original and the private \\nkey is proof -of-ownership of the original.  The content creator\\'s public key \\nserves as a certificate of authenticity for that particular NFT. \\n4.They  live on Ethereum and can be bought and sold on any Ethereum -based \\nNFT market.\\nCurrent use cases for NFTs are in digital entertainment including art and music, but\\nare increasingly being used as assets in gaming. We expect NFTs will become a key \\npart of DeFi with the tokenization of particular value for ill iquid assets.  Below we \\nshow a compare and contrast between the current internet and an NFT internet, \\nwhich is presented by the Ether eum Organization. \\nTable 1: The NFT Internet vs. the Internet Today –A Compare and Contrast\\nAn NFT Internet The Internet Today\\nNFTs are digitally unique, no two NFTs are the \\nsame.A copy of a file, like an .mp3 or .jpg is the same as \\nthe original.\\nEvery NFT must have an owner and this is of public \\nrecord and easy for anyone to verify.Ownership records of digital items are stored on \\nservers controlled by institutions -you must take their \\nword for it.\\nNFTs are compatible with anything built using \\nEthereum.

Morgan.\\nThe Downside of Ethereum –Getting More Congested and \\nExpensive \\nEthereum’s success and popularity have created a number of problems for the \\nnetwork. With increasing numbers of fungible and non -fungible tokens running on \\nEthereum, network congestion have driven gas prices /transaction fees to rise \\nmaterially for Ether eum based transactions, making it expensive to transact on the \\nnetwork. It can regularly cost $40 -$50 per transaction, making the purchase of simple \\nNFTs or th e movement of Ethereum from one wallet to another an expensive \\nproposition. Ethereum is also energy intensive and doesn\\'t communicate well with \\nother blockchains. It\\'s a bit like having a cellphone that can only textusers o n the \\nsame network. Ultimately E thereum’s problem has been its limited ability to scale \\nwith the increasing popularity of the network. \\nLack of Scalability\\nOne of the core problems with the Ethereum platform has been scalability. As more \\nand more decentralized apps use the platform, and transactions increase \\nexponentially, so do the gas fees. Simply put, if there are too many users on the \\nblockchain, it gets more expensive to buy and sell things.\\nIncrease Cost to Transact on Ethereum –Rising Transaction Costs\\nEthereum’s growing popularit y has led to higher transaction costs. Ethereum \\ntransaction fees, also known as “gas,” have been rising for much of 2021 . When we \\ntried to buy NFTs for the kids for presents this holiday season, weended up paying \\nmore in gas fees than in NFT prices.  Whil e in Bitcoin the network itself rewards \\ntransaction verifiers, Ethereum requires those participating in the transaction to cover \\nthe fee.  In Ethereum\\'s current state, only those with larger holdings can make use of \\nthe benefits of its ecosystem. Swapping cryptocurrencies on Uniswap, a \\ndecentralized exchange and liquidity provider on Ethereum\\'s network, costs nearly  \\n$150 earlier this year, making trading small amounts of money impractical .$1mn $6mn $18mn$13bn\\n$bn$2bn$4bn$6bn$8bn$10bn$12bn$14bn\\n2018 2019 2020 2021OpenSea Transaction Volume25North A merica Equity Research\\n10 January 2022Kenneth B.

Processing transactions on Ethereum network requires computational \\npower and gas is the fee paid to miners for providing that computational power. Gas \\nfees are measured in Gwei, the smallest base unit of ETH ‒1/1,000,000,000 of an \\nETH . Gas fees were created to both compensate and incentivize the miners to \\nundertake the computational costs of using the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) to \\nexecute the transaction.  But Gas fees also help keep the Ethereum network secure. \\nAttaching cost to every transaction prevents spamming or accidental infinity loops \\nthat could un intentionally or maliciously con sume the resources of Ethereum and \\nprevent new transactions from being recorded. More complex transactions require \\nmore gas to execute, with t ransactions involving smart contracts costing more than \\ntransfers of ETH between two wallets. Average daily gas prices in Dec 2021 have \\nranged from a low of $62 on Dec 19 to a high of $156 on Dec 4. Because transaction \\nfees need to be paid in Eth, particip ants on the Ethereum blockchain need to acquire \\nETH ,which results in value for ETH.\\nFigure 18: Eth Gas Prices Remains High\\nSource: ycharts.com\\nEthereum Suffers from Slower Transaction Speeds\\nEthereum runs at 15 transactions per second. This is faster than Bitcoin’s 7tps, but is \\nsubstantially slower than the Mas terCard’s network, for example that can process \\n5,000tps. Ethereum transaction speeds are being hurt by a number of factors \\nincluding greater data store needs given the inc reased usage of Ethereum and the \\nneed to drive consensus with an increasing number of nodes. The Blockchain \\ntrilemma reflects the tradeoffs between scalability, security and speed. In the case of \\nEthereum, the network prioritizes security over scalability.020406080100120140160180\\n14-Nov 21-Nov 28-Nov 5-Dec 12-Dec 19-Dec 26-Dec 2-JanEthereum Average Gas Price26North A merica Equity Research\\n10 January 2022Kenneth B.

The upgrade, re ferred to as the Ethereum \\nMerge ,has been long delayed, but is expected to be executed mid -2022 and will \\nconvert Ethereum from a proof -of-work to proof -of-stake. It will ultimately set \\nEthereum for greater scalability, greater transaction speeds and lower transaction \\ncosts. \\nThe more immediate benefits of the merge come from the migration to the Proof -of-\\nStake protocol ,which will drive an immediate improvement in energy efficiency, \\ndecentralization and security. Over time, there is the potential for improvements \\nin transaction speeds from ~ 15 transactions per second today to potentially 100,000 \\nTPS, acc ording to Ethereum founder, Vitalik Buterin.

With other blockchains like B itcoin largely static with just one \\nupgrade in the last four years, Ethereum supports numerous upgrades.  Governance is \\ninformal for Ethereum and happens off -chain. Upgrades to the core Ethereum \\nblockchain are proposed via Ethereum Improvement Proposals (E IPs) that specify \\nnew features or processes for Ethereum. The Ethereum Foundation operates as a non-\\nprofit organization that promotes and supports research, developme nt, and education \\nto produce decentralized applications ,hosts a nallcoredevs call where E IPs are \\nproposed and debated. Participants on allcoredevs calls include develop ers from the \\nEthereum Foundation, researchers from other organizations (including Consensys, \\nNethermind, Sigma Prime, Prysematic Labs) and other volunteers.  EIPs are \\nconsidered , debated, championed, tested, and if all goes well are ultimately \\nimplemented on the Ethereum mainnet. \\nThere were four upgrades of the Ethereum blockchain in 2021, including Berlin in \\nApril, London in August, Altair in October, and Arrow Glacier in Decem ber. The \\nLondon Hark Fork included EIP -1559 that takes a portion of gas fees in Eth that \\nwere paid to miners and ‘burns’ them, thus eliminating supply of Eth and reducing \\ninflation.  EIP -1559 also incorporated variable block sizes that are up to 2x larger to \\nhelp with capacity issues.  The London upgrade included other proposals EIP -3554, \\nEIP-3529, EIP -3198 and EIP -3541 that will help facilitate the transition to proof -of-\\nstake and the Ethereum merge expected in mid -2022.\\nWhat Is Happening in the Ethereum M erge \\nThe Ethereum merge refe rs to merger between the current Ethereum mainnet (PoW) \\nwith the Ethereum Beacon Chain (PoS).

When Ethereum \\nconverts to proof -of-stake, the sel ection process to validate the blockchain will \\nmigrate f rom solving the cryptographic puzzles to token ownership. Those that \\nown mo re Ethereum and/or own it longer will have a greater chance of adding \\nblocks to the Ethereum blockchain and earn a reward.  T he software required to \\nvalidate an Ethereum block in proof -of-stake can be done on a laptop with \\nexpected electricity costs of $150/year.  The proof -of-work protocol used to \\nvalidate the Bitcoin and Ethereum blockchains consumes significant energy as \\nmine rs seek to calculate the nonce. Currently Ethereum mining is estimated to \\nconsume ~44.5TWh/year in aggregate, on the magnitude of the energy Honduras \\nconsumed in 2016. \\n2)Ethereum scalability –Ethereum 2.0 plans to scale its capacity by using a \\nmethod calle d sharding, that is hoped/expected will greatly increase \\ntransaction speeds, potentially scaling its ability to 100,000 transactions per \\nsecond or more. Sharding is a way to partition a database into smaller pieces , \\nspreading execution into 64 new shard ch ains that are more manageable. With a \\nPoW blockchain, most nodes, or co mputers in the network, have an entire copy \\nof the history of transactions. This entire history can take up a lot of space, \\nespecially  for older cryptocurrencies with a long history of transactio ns. With \\nsharding on PoS, the blockchain is cut up into parallel sections, and nodes are \\nassigned to one section instead of having to hold the entirety of the chain\\'s data. \\nThis allows more transactions to be processed simultaneously, greatly in creasing \\nthroughput and transaction speed. Sharding is expected a fter the Ethereum \\nmerge, toward year-end 2022 or 2023. \\n3)Ethereum Deflation –We believe that Ethereum issuance could be deflationary \\nfollowing the merge. Inflation take splace when new tokens are mined (in the \\ncase of proof -of-work) or minting (in the case of proof -of-stake) as part of the \\nrewards given to those that are adding blocks and validating the blockchains. \\nHowever, we estimate that the migration from proof -of-work to proof -of-stake \\ncombined with the burn introduced in EIP -1559 could drive Ethereum to \\ndeflation and negative token issuance. We estimate that Ethereum’s inflation rate \\nwas ~4.2% annually prior to the implementation of EIP -1559. Block rewards of \\n2 Eth for mining Ethereum blocks resulted in ~13,000Eth created each day \\n@2eth x 6,500 blocks/day.  However, EIP-1559 is driving Eth to be burne d \\n(taken out of existence) as a portion of the gas fee is now burnt rather than paid \\nto the miner s.  We note that s ince the introduction of EIP -1559, Eth issuance has \\ndeclined 66% and when transaction activity is particularly elevated, Eth can be \\ndeflationary . \\nTable 2: Burned Rewards since the Introduction of EIP -1559 through Jan 3, 2022\\nETH USD Equivalent\\nBurned 1,342,310 $4,964,190,183\\nRewards 2,031,053 $7,511,321,476\\nTips 249,467 $922,587,702\\nNet Issuance 688,743 $2,547,138,435\\nSource: watchtheburn.com and J.P.

But it also means that with far lower block rewards under \\nproof -of-stake that the burn will likely result in deflation, which depending on \\ntransaction levels and g as-prices could burn 1 -2mn Eth/year. \\nWhat\\'s Next for CryptoCurrencies\\nWe think it important to think about outlook for the cryptomarkets based on use \\ncases and potential.

When you pay \\nwith a credit card for coffee at a cafe, a financial institution sits between you and \\nthe business, with control over the transaction, retaining the authority t o stop or \\npause it and record it in its private ledger. By paying in cryptocurrencies, those \\ninstitutions could be cut out of the picture.  There is ~$3bn of value locked in \\ndecentralized payments in protocols such as Salier. \\nStablecoins : Another form of DeFi is the stablecoin. Cryptocurrencies often \\nexperience sharper price fluctuations than fiat. Stablecoi ns peg cryptocurrencies to \\nnon-cryptocurrencies, such as the US dollar, in order to keep the price under control. \\nWith the ability to send crypto like money, cyptocurrencies could alter the remittance \\nmarkets , B2B payments and cross -border money transfers.  While some see the \\ninterchange -fees charged by credit card companies as being at risk, this is not \\nconsidered the base case for the J.P. Morgan payme nts team. An example of DeFi in \\nstablecoins is Maker, a platform that collateralizes assets to create a stablecoin. \\nTrading : Non -custodial automated market making protocols running a decentralized \\norderbook.  Here, order matching and price -setting can be done completely \\nalgorithmically, allowing peer -to-peer trades of certain crypto assets without any \\nkind of brokerage.  There is ~$31bn locked in Decentralized Exchanges such as \\nUniswap. \\nSaving for the future : Put some of your crypto into savings account a lternatives and \\nearn better interest rates than you’d typically get from a bank.\\nBuying derivatives : Tokenized derivatives created without the need for a third party.  \\nCounterparty agreements are programmatically encoded, reducing the risk for \\nmalicious a ctivity.   Make long or short bets on certain assets. Think of these as the \\ncrypto version of stock options or futures contracts. There is an estimated $4.1bn \\nlocked in DeFi derivative protocols such as Synthetix. 36North A merica Equity Research\\n10 January 2022Kenneth B.

DeFi is distinct because it \\nexpands the use of blockchain from simple value transfer to more complex \\nfinancial use cases. Cutting out middlemen from all kinds of transactions is one \\nof the primary  advantages of decentralized finance.\\n\\uf0b7Open: You don’t need to apply for anything or “open” an account. You just get \\naccess by creating a wallet.\\n\\uf0b7Pseudonon ymous: You don’t need to provide your name, email address, or any \\npersonal information.\\n\\uf0b7Flexible: You can move your assets anywhere at any time, without asking for \\npermission, waiting for long transfers to finish, and paying expensive fees\\n\\uf0b7Fast: Interest Rates and rewards often update rapidly (as quickly as every 15 \\nseconds), and can be signific antly  higher than traditional Wall Street.\\n\\uf0b7Transparent: Everyone involved can see the full set of transactions (private \\ncorporations rarely grant that kind of transparency) .\\n37North A merica Equity Research\\n10 January 2022Kenneth B.

As mentioned above, the \\ndownside is network congestion and the impact that has on increasing gas costs and \\ntransaction expenses.  As such, DeFi that results in active transactions ca n be very \\nexpensive.  Other issues such as token volatility, the need to monitor transactions for \\ntax purposes and varying regulation from one region to another are also highlighted \\nas risks to DeFi. \\nTraditional Financial Services Companies Start to Embra ce Cryptocurrency \\nTechnology.\\n\\uf0b7Traditional Financial Services firms are servicing clients that want to engage in \\nthe cry ptoecosystem.  There are also examples where financial firms are \\nembracing the cryptoecosystem to make traditional financial offerings be tter.  \\nHere, we see traditional financial services on the front -end, but DeFi powering \\nthe back -end.  However, we see the current regulatory environment (really the \\nlack of Federal Crypto Rules and Regulation) limiting the presence that \\ntraditional finance can have in crypto.  There is just too much to lose if new rules \\nare put into place that run contrary to the ways that traditional financial service \\nfirms might be engaging with crypto.
